# Maintaining Dristi's agent team

The owner’s intent is a thinking partner, a DS-based builder, and an independent reviewer.
Current task decisions travel in a concise agreement; historical feature documents are
maintained for the owner and are not automatically loaded as build instructions.

## Owner-controlled agents — decision, 2026-09-15

The owner invokes an agent only by explicitly tagging its name in the active task,
for example `@ux-designer`, `@ui-designer`, or `@ui-reviewer`. The tag authorizes that
named role for the task, including focused follow-ups to an existing spawned agent.
One tag never authorizes another role or an automatic UX → build → review chain.
The coordinator performs untagged stages and a separate review pass when needed;
it identifies that pass as non-independent. Skills may still guide the coordinator
without spawning an agent.

This is an instruction boundary in `.agents/policies/`, not a tool-level conditional
spawn lock. Rails checks confirm generated configuration, not whether a live agent
obeyed the tag rule. Do not disable subagents globally: that would also prevent the
owner from invoking a tagged agent.

## Sources and generated files

| Edit here | Generated or consumed there |
|---|---|
| `.agents/policies/project.md` | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor project rule |
| `.agents/roles/*.md` and `.agents/rails.json` | Codex TOML, Claude agents, Cursor role rules |
| DS/server policies declared in `.agents/rails.json` | Claude and Cursor rules |
| `.agents/skills/` | Codex discovery; complete Claude/Cursor mirrors including references |
| `.agents/verification.json` | Executable verification profiles |

All instruction paths are repository-relative unless marked skill-relative. Skill-relative
Markdown links work in all mirrors. The old `propose-ui-brief` name is retained as a short
compatibility route to `design-ui` or `document-ui-feature`.

```bash
npm run sync:rails
npm run verify:agents
```

Generation is explicit: no install hook, background watcher, or automatic edits to another
checkout. Unmatched managed files cause a failure rather than being silently deleted.
The Agent rails GitHub workflow runs verification on PRs and pushes to long-lived
branches, without installing dependencies or starting the app. Making this check required
for merging remains a repository branch-protection setting; this change does not alter it.
When adding a skill, create its `SKILL.md` under `.agents/skills/` and regenerate. When
adding a role, declare its metadata/adapters in `.agents/rails.json` and its body under
`.agents/roles/`. Canonical skill frontmatter uses `name` and a one-line JSON-quoted
`description` (a valid YAML subset); the checker rejects unsupported metadata instead
of silently stripping it. Extend the parser deliberately if more metadata becomes needed.

The checker validates all expected files, unexpected files, resource mirrors, local
references, root command names, and adapter boundaries. Its regression suite changes
fixtures in temporary directories only. Byte equality proves configuration consistency,
not reasoning quality. Human review of source changes remains necessary.

## Runtime boundaries

- Codex UX/reviewer adapters request `sandbox_mode = "read-only"`; live permission
  overrides may change effective behavior. This migration validates configuration, not
  a running session's sandbox. The builder inherits existing session permissions.
- Claude UX/reviewer adapters omit Bash, Write, and Edit. Commands and new render evidence
  are obtained by the coordinator where necessary. Do not treat a skill as authorization
  to bypass the role's non-writing responsibility.
- Cursor role rules are advisory and do not enforce filesystem isolation.
- Existing model choices are preserved: Claude roles use their previous `opus` choice;
  Codex roles inherit the session. No model or global permission settings are changed.

See [verification](../.agents/policies/verification.md) for criteria, evidence reuse, and
pending status when an environment is unavailable.

## Rollout and rollback

Land the cleanup through a PR into `design` with owner approval. Existing Cursor work
continues on its own branch until the owner chooses to integrate the change. Do not
switch an active checkout or restart its server to adopt the new configuration.

After integration, start a fresh task in the intended checkout and confirm the tool
lists the three roles and canonical skills. Reload the tool if discovery is stale; do
not interrupt an ongoing task. Configuration checks do not prove live discovery.

Rollback is a revert of the cleanup commit through a PR. Product code, the DS pin,
dependency versions, launch configuration, and historical feature records are unchanged.
No performance percentage is claimed: extended feature/latency trials were intentionally
excluded; validation covers configuration, generation, and regression detection.

## Decisions behind this change — owner, 2026-09-13

- Preserve the three roles, but separate brainstorming from archive writing.
- Keep owner-facing history without automatically adding it to future agent context.
- Use concise handoffs and independent review for substantial/consequential changes;
  avoid compulsory three-agent execution for small, fully specified corrections.
- Centralize shared instructions while preserving tool-specific capability differences.
- Implement in an isolated worktree so ongoing Cursor work and the server are unaffected.
- Skip an extended benchmark pilot; retain quick configuration/regression checks.
