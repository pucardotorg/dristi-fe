/**
 * check:table-rows — one table treatment, owned in one place.
 *
 * The panel-inset queues (the ones on `border-separate`, so the header strip can round
 * itself into a well) had grown sixteen private copies of the same four class strings.
 * Then one copy learned something the other fifteen did not: how to round a hovered
 * row. The register went on painting a square band under a rounded header for weeks and
 * every gate stayed green, because duplicated constants that agree today are not a
 * drift any of them can see.
 *
 * So this gate does not check appearance. It checks that the treatment is still owned
 * by `components/chrome/table-plate.ts` — the one file where fixing it fixes the
 * product. Its rules are derived from that module's own exports, so retuning the plate
 * never means retuning the gate.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the `border-separate` family. A table clipped by a rounded card
 * (`tasks-table`, via `overflow-clip`) solves the corner problem a different and equally
 * correct way, and the full-bleed tables inside a case file have no corner to cut.
 * Widening this to every `<Table>` would flag both as broken.
 *
 * Escape hatch: `table-plate-allow` on the offending line or the one above it, for a
 * reviewed exception. It is not a licence to re-fork the treatment.
