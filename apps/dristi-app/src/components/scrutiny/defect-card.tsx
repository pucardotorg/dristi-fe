/**
 * One defect, worked on in the panel (brief v3.2).
 *
 * v2.1 put a layer under the flagged field *and* a row in the queue, so every defect spoke
 * twice and all of the officer's evidence was expanded before anyone had decided they
 * needed it. v3 gave each side one job: the form is the record, and this card — in the
 * panel — is the only place a correction is made. That is why nothing here is repeated on
 * the form, and why the form's control is no longer editable at all.
 *
 * The card is three things, top to bottom:
 *
 *   1. **What it is** — the field, and where it lives.
 *   2. **Why it was flagged** — the officer's comment.
 *   3. **The fix** — the field's own control (or *Replace this document*), Save, and
 *      *Keep as filed* for a value the advocate believes is already right.
 *
 * The officer says what is wrong; the advocate makes the fix. There is no proposed value
 * to accept or reject, no voice note, no marked page, and no reply to scrutiny (owner,
 * 2026-10-08).
 * Keeping the filed value asks for no reason — the gate must not force an edit to a value
 * the advocate believes is correct (owner, 2026-10-08).
 *
 * Resolution is derived from the filing (D6), never self-certified: a field counts once
 * its value differs from what scrutiny saw, or once it is kept as filed. The collapse waits for the *act* to end, not
 * the state to flip — a field resolves on its first keystroke, and collapsing then
 * unmounts the input under the advocate's fingers (the one-character bug, owner
 * 2026-08-21).
