/**
 * Scrutiny return — the correction round.
 *
 * The filing came back from the Registry with defects; this is where the advocate sees
 * exactly what was flagged, fixes it *in the filing itself*, and submits the corrections.
 * It is the e-filing form re-entered in a correction posture (brief D2), not a second
 * form: same steps, same section components, same validation. Three panes — the sections,
 * the section, the resolution queue — with the queue as the spine (D5).
 *
 * The two rules that shape everything else:
 *
 *   · **Nothing unflagged can be edited** (D3, owner's answer to O5). A correction round
 *     is not an edit round, and the reason is stated as text in each section rather than
 *     hidden in a tooltip on a dead control.
 *   · **Resolved is derived, never certified** (D6). The screen reconciles each defect's
 *     recorded resolution against what the filing actually holds — see `lib/tasks/defects`
 *     — so nothing counts because someone ticked it.
 *
 * Derivation is live; the *record* is not. What the advocate sees — the frame's state, the
 * queue's count, the submit gate — recomputes on every keystroke from the draft. What the
 * task's history receives is written only when a human act finishes: focus leaves the
 * field, typing pauses, a suggestion is accepted, or the corrections are submitted. A
 * history that gained a line per keystroke would be a log of the keyboard, not of the work.
