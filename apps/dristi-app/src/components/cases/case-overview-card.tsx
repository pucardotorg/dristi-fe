 *
 * A deadline and the note saying who holds it were the same grey caption,
 * which is how a deadline goes missing on a card where nothing is late yet.
 * The badge now carries every rung rather than only the late and the
 * imminent: an escalation that fires on no row of the case in front of you
 * is one the reader never learns to read, and the row changed shape between
 * its states, so the eye had to re-find the deadline card by card. Same
 * structure throughout — interval in the badge, date plain beside it — and
 * only the fill ranks.
 *
 * `warning` for work owed before the next sitting is caution, not error, and
 * this codebase already spends it that way on the Long pending flag. `info`
 * would be wrong: a deadline is not an aside. Both status rungs use the
 * opaque `-muted` fills the Badge variants carry, never an alpha wash
 * (Laws — no alpha status fills).
 *
 * The badge holds the interval alone. The date is what the work is planned
 * against rather than part of the status, and a badge wide enough to hold
 * "Due in 6 days · 17 August 2026" has stopped reading as a status. Colour
 * is never alone either way (ACCESSIBILITY 3): the badge states the interval
 * in words, so the fill is emphasis on a fact, not the fact.
