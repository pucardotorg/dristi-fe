/**
 * A register row as a touch card whose actions wait in a tray (owner, Sept 21).
 *
 * The advocate Home hearing card is the reference, as it is for the Pending
 * tasks cards: the card is the trigger and sits above its tray; the tray is
 * inset from both edges and squared at the top, so it reads as sliding out from
 * under the card. A list of these stays a list to scan, and only the row in
 * hand shows what can be done with it. A card with its button always showing
 * made every row shout, and a card with no button at all hid the way in.
 *
 * The title is the one control on the face, its hit area stretched over the
 * card. Anything else interactive on the face needs `relative z-10`.
