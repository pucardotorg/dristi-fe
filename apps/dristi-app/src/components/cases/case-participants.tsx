/**
 * Everyone on the case: one grouped list, and a pane for whoever is open.
 *
 * **Rows are links, so selection is not state.** Each row is an anchor to
 * `?selected=`, which buys four things a click handler would have to re-earn:
 * a participant is deep-linkable, a refresh lands on the same person, the
 * server renders the pane the URL asked for, and keyboard operation is the
 * browser's own Tab-and-Enter rather than a hand-rolled roving tabindex. This
 * is navigation between views, not a form control, so it is a `nav` of links
 * with `aria-current` (ACCESSIBILITY: prefer native semantics). It also means
 * the whole section is a server component — no `use client`, no router, no
 * hydration cost.
 *
 * **Layering (ui-craft §4).** Page → this one panel → wells inside it. The
 * master list sits on the card fill; the detail pane's fact rows are the only
 * wells. Selection is a single quiet cue — `accent-strong`, the DS's
 * documented selected fill — never fill *and* border *and* bar stacked.
 *
 * **The pane's facts go two up**, keyed to the pane's own width rather than the
 * viewport's: the pane is a grid track, so at 1024px the master rail leaves it
 * a phone's width while a `lg:` rule would call it desktop. An odd number of
 * sections gives the last one the whole row and lets its wells go two up
 * inside it, so a well is about half a pane wide whatever the participant
 * carries and no section is stranded beside a hole. Stacked full-bleed, each
 * well was one short name on a field of grey four times its width.
 *
 * **The master list codes side by colour, on the owner's call** — see
 * `SIDE_PILL`. ds-requests #1 (no token family for categorical marks) is still
 * open, so this borrows the status families rather than closing it: the
 * request stands, and a `tag-*` family would be the honest home for these.
 *
 * ## Three things the mockup drew that are not here
 *
 * Each would have had the screen assert something the product cannot.
 *
 * **"BAR REGISTERED" tag on every advocate.** No bar-registration field exists
 * anywhere in the model and no product doc records one. The tag is a
 * *verification*: rendering it would tell a court user the registry has
 * confirmed something it has never been asked. Omitted outright rather than
 * stubbed — a stubbed verification is worse than none.
 *
 * **"Edit party" button** — originally omitted because no application type
 * carried it. It exists now as the pencil on the detail header (own side
 * only): the party-actions phase gave corrections their own application flow
 * (`edit-litigant-dialog.tsx`), pre-filled from the record and ending in the
 * generated-application chain, so the button no longer has to borrow the
 * Raise-application flow's types.
 *
 * **"Case timeline associations" tiles.** "Appeared on <date>" is not
 * derivable: `hearings-dummy.json` records attendance as opaque
 * `participantIds` (`PARTY-C-001`, `PARTY-A-001`) with no registry mapping
 * them to parties — and one `PARTY-A-001` covers all three accused on c-1001,
 * so no per-party appearance date exists to show. "Represented by" restated
 * the Representation section directly above it, and named one advocate where
 * two are assigned. The section became **Linked witnesses**, derived from data
 * that does exist and shown nowhere else on the pane.
 *
 * Absent by omission rather than error: `supportPeople` stays in the model.
 * This mockup has no surface for juniors and clerks; the data and its
 * derivation are intact for the next one that does.
