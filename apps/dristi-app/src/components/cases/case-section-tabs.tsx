/**
 * In-file section nav. Line TabsList (underline), not the pill track —
 * case peek uses the same chrome; the cases list keeps default because
 * those are mutually exclusive populations. Height only on TabsList
 * (h-10). Nine destinations will not fit a phone width, so the row
 * scrolls rather than crushing labels (RESPONSIVE).
 *
 * The primitive hangs the mark at after:bottom-[-5px] for a padded
 * track. overflow-x-auto clips that hang (x-scroll forces y-clip), so
 * catching it with pb-1 leaves a gap above the divider. Sit the mark
 * at after:-bottom-px so it meets the divider.
 *
 * Two renderings, because a section can be routable without being in the
 * strip (`UNLISTED_SECTIONS` — Hearings today). Arriving at one of those, the
 * strip has no tab to mark, and a `Tabs` whose value matches no trigger is
 * not a cosmetic gap: no trigger carries `aria-selected="true"`, so the
 * widget tells a screen-reader user they are on none of nine tabs while the
 * page plainly shows them somewhere, and Radix still labels the visible panel
 * with an `aria-labelledby` pointing at a trigger id that was never rendered.
 * Both are WAI-ARIA 1.2 defects (ACCESSIBILITY 2, 3).
 *
 * So an unlisted section drops the tab widget and the row renders as what it
 * has been all along — links to the rest of the case file, none of them
 * current. Navigation with no current item is ordinary; a tablist with no
 * selected tab is not. It is also the way back: every other section is one
 * click away, in the same place and the same order as on every other screen,
 * and the section you are on names itself in its own heading below.
 *
 * The row is the same row either way — same gutter, same metrics, same
 * resting and focus treatment, off the constants above — so nothing shifts
 * when you cross the branch.
