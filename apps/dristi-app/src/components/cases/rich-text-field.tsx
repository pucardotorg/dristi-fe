/**
 * Formatted long-form input, composed at screen level.
 *
 * The design system has no rich text editor (ds-requests #7), so this borrows
 * DS chrome rather than inventing any: an InputGroup supplies the bordered
 * well, focus ring and invalid state that Textarea would have given, and the
 * marks are DS ToggleGroups in a `role="toolbar"` strip. Nothing under
 * `components/ui` is edited or forked.
 *
 * **The toolbar is transparent, and the 40px buttons stay 40px** (2026-09-14). The marks
 * were `ToggleGroup variant="outline"`, so every one of the seven carried a border and a
 * card fill: three bordered blocks of form-weight controls above a paragraph, which is
 * the whole reason the field read as unfinished. `default` is the toolbar treatment — the
 * button is nothing at rest, `accent` on hover, `accent-strong` when it is on, so the one
 * mark on the strip is the format actually in force. **Do not shrink the buttons to make
 * the strip lighter**: `ACCESSIBILITY.md` §8 puts the interactive floor at 40×40 and says
 * a smaller visual must expand its hit area to reach it, so the size is the target and
 * the size was never what looked heavy. The border was.
 *
 * InputGroupAddon is not the toolbar. That slot is prefix chrome (a dialling
 * code, a search icon) — `cursor-text`, muted label colour, click-to-focus an
 * `<input>`. Putting ToggleGroups there made the strip read as a second field
 * row. The layout hook InputGroup already exposes (`h-auto flex-col`) is
 * enough to stack a toolbar above the control.
 *
 * The editing surface itself is the piece the DS cannot supply — a
 * contentEditable region driven by document.execCommand. That API is
 * deprecated but still the only dependency-free way to get bold, italic,
 * lists and alignment out of one surface.
 */

         * a typist reaching for a new line would otherwise put the court's words into
         * the order instead of a line into their own writing. Tab is the convention for
         * accepting an inline completion and it costs this field nothing: a
         * `contentEditable` region has no tab stop inside it to lose.
         *
         * ↓ and ↑ walk the other answers without opening a list, which is the whole
         * point of completing inline rather than in a menu. Escape puts the preview away
         * and leaves every character the reader typed, including the slash: taking their
         * text back out on their behalf would be this field editing a court record
         * nobody asked it to touch.
         *
         * **Only the keys that could edit *into* the node take it down.** Every key used
         * to, and redrawing on the `input` that followed meant the preview blinked out
         * and back on every character typed — the jitter that made this read as forced.
         * A printable key inserts at the caret, which is *before* the node, so the node
         * is in no danger and stays where it is; `paintSuggestion` then moves it without
         * a repaint. Backspace and Delete work at exactly the boundary it sits on, and
         * Enter would split the block around it, so those three clear it first and the
         * next `input` draws it again.
