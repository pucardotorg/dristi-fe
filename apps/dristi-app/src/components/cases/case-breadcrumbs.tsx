 * The trail for anything that lives under one case: `Cases › the case › here`.

 * printed on every paper the person holds — and it links back to the case file
 * whenever a further crumb follows it, so a person three levels in can step out one
 * level rather than all the way to the list. The top bar supplies the Cases root and
 * links it, because publishing any crumb at all is what turns the root into a link.
