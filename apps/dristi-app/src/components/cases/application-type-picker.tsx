/**
 * Step one of Raise application: pick what you are asking the court for.
 *
 * The types are cards, not a list of names, because the name alone is not the
 * choice — "Condonation of delay" tells a first-time filer nothing, and picking
 * wrong costs them a whole form. Each card says what that type asks for;
 * choosing one is what advances.
 *
 * Two things order the cards, and neither hides one. Before anything is typed
 * the case's stage leads: the asks that usually come up there sit first, the
 * rest follow under their own heading. Once the filer types, their sentence
 * outranks the stage — they have said what they want, and a guess from the
 * stage should not argue with it.
 *
 * The search itself lives in the page header (`ApplicationTypeSearch`), so the
 * query is the parent's state and arrives here as a prop.
