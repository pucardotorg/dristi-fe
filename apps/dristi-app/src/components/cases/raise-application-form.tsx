 *
 * Two steps, because they are two different jobs. Choosing the type is a
 * decision: the types are cards that say what each one asks the court for,
 * led by what the case's stage usually calls for and searchable by name.
 * Filling the chosen type's fields is the second, and it happens in a dialog
 * over the chooser (owner, Sept 21: every type files from a modal, as bail
 * does). Closing it returns to the chooser, never to the case.
 *
 * There is no separate review step: Generate application validates the form
 * and opens the generated document, which restates every entered value as
 * the filing — the document is the review. From there the signature dialogs
 * mirror the legacy portal's chain: generated document → Add signature →
 * Upload signed document.
