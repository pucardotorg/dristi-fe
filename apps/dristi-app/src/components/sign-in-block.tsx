/**
 * The page under the onboarding modal.
 *
 * Four structural decisions, all load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **The number goes first, alone.** One field and Continue. The number is checked
 *    before anything else is asked, so nobody types a password for an account that does
 *    not exist and nobody is told "wrong password" when the truth is "no account". An
 *    unknown number is stated as a fact under the field — no redirect, no offer; the
 *    standing "Create an account" link is one line down for the person who meant it.
 *    A known number slides the second step in from the right (the Google pattern the
 *    owner attached), with the number shown locked at the top and a way back beside it.
 *
 * 2. **Method is chosen on the second step, next to the credential it governs.** A
 *    small labelled toggle, not a full-width strip — the number field above it is the
 *    only wide control, so there is nothing to confuse it with.
 *
 * 3. **The page is a grid, not two stacked flex columns.** The canvas has to run the
 *    full height of the viewport while the footer stays a slim bar under the form
 *    column only; a two-row grid with the canvas spanning both does that directly.
 *
 * 4. **The canvas is desktop-only.** On phones it collapsed into a second page bolted
 *    to the bottom of the first. Its one piece of real content, the explainer, is
 *    re-rendered inline in the form column instead — see `HelpEntry`.

 *
 * The phone version drops the canvas entirely. A gradient plate wrapped around a card
 * wrapped around a button is three container levels for one link, and at 375px it read
 * as a second page bolted to the bottom of the first. A rule and the page's own type
 * says the same thing and costs nothing.
 *
 * The action follows the explanation in a single vertical reading path. The one fact
