/**
 * Sign the complaint — the document in the column, and one rail beside it carrying both
 * who has signed and what you can do about it (stacked above the document below `xl`).
 *
 * It keeps the filing's Sections rail like every other step: the old two-rail layout ate
 * the width the rail needed, which left Sign the one screen you could not navigate out of
 * the way the rest of the flow had taught you.
 *
 * Committing to a mode is its own step, not a click on the rail: the rail carries one
 * "Continue to signing" button ("Sign and take your oath" when you sign as an advocate,
 * since the oath follows the signature in the same window), which opens a dialog naming
 * both paths and what each one does to the *other* signatories — before either is
 * clickable, not after. Nothing here is a private action; every party on the complaint
 * signs the one way that was chosen.
 *
 * The paying half of the flow lives here too: fees → process and address → payment →
 * the case file number. The document itself is the shared court sheet Preview renders.
 *
 * Signing and payment are the one part of this flow with no real system behind them yet.
 * They are wired to the draft (who signed, in what mode, what was chosen, what was
 * "paid") and every screen that stands in for a real service says so in place.

        court fees decide whether the complaint is registered at all, process fees buy
        delivery to the accused. Every line shows its rate and how many times it is
        charged, because the per-round and per-address ones move with the case and a
        total nobody can account for is a total nobody should be asked to pay. There is
