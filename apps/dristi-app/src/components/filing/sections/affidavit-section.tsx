/**
 * Affidavit — the sworn half of the complaint, composed from the case and left editable.
 *
 * Everything here is generated from what the draft already records: the return reason is
 * quoted from the memo, and the payment and service sentences follow what the demand
 * notice says happened (`affidavitHtml`). That is the starting point, not the answer —
 * this is sworn under BNSS s.225 and only the filer knows whether the standard recitals
 * fit their facts, so it is theirs to change.
 *
 * Until they change it the text keeps tracking the case, so correcting a date three
 * screens back corrects the affidavit too. The moment they edit, it stops tracking and
 * becomes their words — with one control to put the standard text back, because an edit
 * that cannot be undone is an edit people are afraid to make.
