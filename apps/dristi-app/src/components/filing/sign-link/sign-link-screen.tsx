/**
 * **`/sign` — where a signing link lands.**
 *
 * When a complaint is sent for signature, every party not at the filer's keyboard gets a
 * link by SMS. This is the other end of it. The person arriving did not start this
 * filing and may never have used DRISTI, so the page explains itself before it asks for
 * anything: who is filing, against whom, in which court, what they are named as, and what
 * they are about to do.
 *
 * Then, in one window of stages (the product's staged-overlay pattern, as the filer's own
 * signing window is):
 *
 * 1. **Why you got this link** — the case, their part in it, and the steps ahead.
 * 2. **Sign in** — signing and the oath are tied to an account, so a person who is not
 *    signed in does that first, and someone new registers through the same flow as
 *    everywhere else (`SignInBlock`).
 * 3. **E-sign** — Aadhaar OTP or DSC, the same cards as the filer's.
 * 4. **The oath** — complainants and advocates alike, straight after their signature
 *    (`OathCapture`), read in their own name.
 *
 * Both acts are shown from the start ("E-sign", then "Oath") so the second never
 * arrives as a surprise. A complaint signed on paper skips the e-signature: the link is
 * for the oath alone.
 *
 * **A complainant goes into File a case.** Once a litigant has signed in or registered,
 * the complaint opens inside the product's shell, under File a case
 * (`/filings/sign-request`, `inShell`), with the signing window over it — not on this
 * standalone page — and their home lists it among their cases (`linked-complaints.ts`).
 * An advocate's link goes the same way, into their own File a case.
 *
 * Sandbox: no SMS is sent and no session is real. The filer opens this from the Sign
 * step, and signing in here only marks this tab as signed in. The page reads and writes
 * the same draft the filer has, so what is done here shows on the filer's Sign step.
