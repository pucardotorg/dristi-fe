/**
 * The scrolling column of a filing screen.
 *
 * A `div`, not a `main`: inside `FilingShell` the landmark is the shell's own `main`, and
 * the two screens outside it (upload, sign) carry theirs.
 *
 * The column carries `bg-muted` (neutral-2) in light mode — the one warm step that
 * separates the form canvas from the white cards on it. Filling a long form is a
 * one-card-at-a-time job, and on a white-on-white page the panel edge rests entirely on a
 * 5% shadow, which is the first thing to vanish on a poor display or for a reader with low
 * vision. The tint is scoped to this column on purpose: the top bar and the sticky footer
 * stay `bg-card` white, so the tint reads as the writing surface rather than as a grey
 * page. The Sections rail already sat on `bg-sidebar` (also neutral-2) and so shares the
 * canvas tone — that is the composition the owner chose from the studies, with the cards
 * as the only white.
 *
 * Dark mode deliberately keeps `bg-background`: there, `muted` is neutral-2, which the DS
 * assigns to `surface-raised`, while cards sit at neutral-1 — tinting the canvas would put
 * the page *above* the cards and read them as recesses. The DS keeps dark flat on purpose
 * ("Dark stays flat: page and card share neutral-1", globals.css), so dark is unchanged
 * and its depth question belongs upstream, not here.
 *
 * Owner-approved 2026-08-26 from the canvas studies (variant 3, "Whisper + lift");
 * supersedes the blanket no-grey-canvas rule for the filing form only.
