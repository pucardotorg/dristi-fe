 * This module owns *presentation only*: where the rail sits, what ground it is painted
 * on, how a row and a section label are measured, how tall the bar is and what separates
 * it from the page. It knows nothing about tasks, profiles, locales, notifications,
 * breadcrumbs or courts. Every one of those arrives as a slot, and an area that has none
 * of them passes nothing.
 *
 * That constraint is the whole point. Two areas — the advocate's and the bench's — need
 * the same chrome and share none of their content, so anything content-shaped that leaks
 * in here would have to be conditioned on which area is rendering, and the frame would
 * stop being a frame. `/employee` consumes it today; the advocate's `AppShell` migrates
 * onto it in a follow-up, and the API below is sized for what that shell already does:
 * a controlled open state, a 4rem icon rail, a footer under the nav, and a bar whose
 * three regions it fills itself.

 * Centre a portalled overlay over the page column instead of over the whole window.

 * `DialogContent` is `fixed left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`, so it centres on the viewport —
 * and the viewport here starts 16rem left of where the page does. Measured on the court
 * screens at 1699px: a `5xl` dialog sat 82px off the rail with 337px of air to its right.
 * That is mathematically centred and visibly leaning, because the reader's frame is the
 * page, not the window.
 *
 * So above `md` the box spans the page column instead: `left` at the rail plus a gutter,
 * `right` at the matching gutter, `w-auto` because a specified width makes the `right`
 * offset a no-op (an over-constrained box drops it), `translate-x-0` to hand centring
 * back to the offsets, and `mx-auto` to split whatever the dialog's own `max-w-*` leaves
 * over. The dialog keeps its own width cap; this only decides where the slack goes, so a
 * column narrower than the cap yields the gutters instead of overflowing the page.
 *
 * Below `md` the rail is off-canvas and the window *is* the page, so none of it applies.
 * The scrim is untouched — modality still covers the rail, only the sheet moves.
 *
 * **A hook, because the left edge moves.** This was a constant while the rail was always
 * 16rem; a folding rail makes 17rem wrong for half the states, and wrong in the direction
 * the docstring above exists to prevent — at 4rem the left bound sits 208px inside the
 * page column while the right gutter stays at 16px, and below the width cap the box is
 * pinned against that dead space outright.
 *
 * The fix is not to hoist the width into CSS. `DialogContent` portals to `document.body`,
 * so `--sidebar-width`, `--sidebar-width-icon` and the rail's `data-collapsible` are all
 * out of scope inside it, and the tempting repair is to mirror the current width onto
 * `:root` from an effect and read it back with `var()`. That works, and it buys a global
 * mutation, a first-paint gap where the property is unset, and a teardown to get wrong —
 * to solve a problem CSS does not have to solve. The class is *computed* by a component
 * that renders in-tree, where the width is already in scope, and only *applied* to a
 * portalled node. So the reading happens in React and the portal receives a finished
 * string.

 * the bar is not a descendant of the rail, so no `group-*` variant of the rail's own

 * fold. `isMobile` is deliberately not in it: `useIsMobile`'s query and the `md`
 * breakpoint are exact complements, so the width half of the question is answered once, in

/**
 * The navigation rail, on its plate.
 *
 * **It renders through the DS's `collapsible="none"` branch in both states.** That is the only
 * one of the three that keeps a plate. The other two fork to a `Sheet` on mobile and
 * spread the caller's props onto `Sheet.Root` — a Radix Root, which renders no DOM node —
 * while `className` is destructured out of those props and never applied at all. So below
 * `md` the plate's custom properties land on nothing and the seam, the ink and the ground
 * all revert: a charcoal rail comes back in the app's default light ink. This frame
 * therefore owns its own plated `ChromeRailSheet` and never lets the DS pick the mobile
 * branch, in either mode.
 *
 * Which leaves the desktop fold to build here rather than delegate. The `none` branch
 * spreads props onto its own `div` and merges `className` through `cn`, so the frame can
 * dress that div as the primitive dresses its icon-mode container: `group` plus
 * `data-collapsible` on the *same* element (a `group-*` variant needs a descendant, so
 * splitting them across two elements matches nothing), and a width the variant overrides.
 * `data-[collapsible=icon]:w-…` rather than `group-data-…` for the width itself, because
 * the rail is not its own descendant either — and it beats the primitive's base
 * `w-(--sidebar-width)` on both counts: tailwind-merge keeps both (different modifiers)
 * and the attribute selector adds the specificity that settles it.
 *
 * The pay-off is that every `group-data-[collapsible=icon]:` utility already written into
 * `RAIL_ROW`, `RAIL_BRAND_ROW` and the DS's own menu primitives — inert while nothing
 * declared the state — starts working, and the fold costs the rail's contents nothing but
 * the shape decisions only they can make.

/**
 * The bar across the top of the screen.
 *
 * Chrome, not a panel: `bg-card` on the white page with a hairline seam, so it reads as a
 * fixed edge rather than a card that happens to sit at the top. `sticky` is positioned, so
 * an area can hang a second row under it at full width.
 *
 * Three regions and no opinion about what goes in them. The advocate fills all three. The
 * bench fills `leading` with the control that reopens the rail — shown whenever the rail
 * is not carrying one itself, which is below `md` and while it is folded to a strip — and
 * `children` at every width. `ChromePageColumn` publishes the fold for that rule to read.
 *
 * **The breadcrumb convention, for whoever moves the next area onto this frame.** Three
 * bars in this app draw a trail and two of them open by calling themselves the only one,
 * so the rule is written here, where the next author is already reading:
 *
 * 1. **Derive the trail from the navigation data the rail already renders**, not from a
 *    provider a screen pushes to. A section renamed in one place is then renamed in both,
 *    and no screen can quietly teach the bar a name for a section that the rail disagrees
 *    with. Reach for a provider only for a crumb the route genuinely cannot supply — the
 *    name of the specific thing on an editor screen, say — and let it supply that crumb
 *    alone rather than the whole trail.
 * 2. **The page is not a step.** Screens open with their own heading, so a last crumb
 *    repeating it puts the same words on screen twice, quietest directly above loudest.
 *    Carry the steps *above* the page — the ones that are somewhere to go back to.
 * 3. **Pin the root, shrink the tail.** The root is usually the only route back to an
 *    area's origin; the tail can be clipped without being unlinked.
 *
 * None of this is a fact about any one area, which is why it sits with the frame and not
 * with an area's bar.
