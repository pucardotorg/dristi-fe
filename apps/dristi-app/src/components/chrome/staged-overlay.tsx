/**
 * **One overlay, however many questions it has to ask.**
 *
 * A court-side act is rarely one moment. Reading a registration and deciding on it,
 * choosing a date and signing the order, confirming a bulk signature and being told what
 * it did — each of those is two or three moments, and the product's rule is that they are
 * *stages of one window*, never a second window (`ui-craft` §7 and its motion reference:
 * "a flow progresses inside one modal; confirmations, composers and outcomes are stages,
 * not stacked dialogs").
 *
 * That rule was settled on the registrations overlay (owner, 2026-09-11: approving
 * *"takes two screens that feel like one act"*) and restated when the bulk reschedule act
 * was rebuilt on it (owner, 2026-09-16: *"right now it abruptly changes to a new modal —
 * that shouldn't happen at all, everything should happen in one modal with all those
 * motion+interaction"*). This file exists because the owner then asked for that same
 * interaction on **every** court-side modal, and a rule that sixteen overlays each
 * hand-write is a rule that sixteen overlays each drift from. `motion.ts` already made
 * this argument for the class strings; this makes it for the frame those classes hang on.
 *
 * ## What the frame guarantees
 *
 * Getting this right turned out to be four things, and all four are things a call site
 * gets wrong by omission rather than by choice — which is exactly what belongs in a
 * shared frame rather than in a convention:
 *
 * 1. **The chrome holds still.** A header or footer that swaps instantly over a stage
 *    that animates is half the abruptness on its own. The header and footer are rendered
 *    once, outside the animated element; only the stage between them travels. That is
 *    what makes them read as a frame rather than as part of the thing that changed.
 * 2. **The window does not resize under the reader.** A dialog is centred, so a stage
 *    shorter than the last one does not merely shrink the box — it moves the whole panel
 *    up the screen on the way. The stage canvas carries a floor (`floor`) so pressing on
 *    keeps the frame where it was.
 * 3. **The entrance is keyed on the *scene*, not on the stage.** Mounting is what plays
 *    an animation, so a stage that shares a scene with the one before it never gets one.
 *    This is how a guarded act and its outcome stay one beat: the card being signed is
 *    the same card that was signed, in the same place, with a band resolving across it.
 * 4. **Focus follows the stage.** A stage that slides away takes its controls with it,
 *    and focus left on a button that has just been unmounted drops to the document with a
 *    modal still open. `useStagedFlow` moves it to the line that just changed.
 *
 * ## What the call site still owns
 *
 * The width and height the act needs (`className`), what each stage says, what its footer
 * offers, and the scenes themselves. The frame does not know what a registration or a
 * bail bond is, and should not learn.
 *
 * @see useStagedFlow — the stage, direction and focus half of the same pattern.

 * Both overlays that hand-wrote this asked the same question — *is this the stage we
