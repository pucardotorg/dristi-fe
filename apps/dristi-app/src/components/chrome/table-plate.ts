/**
 * The one treatment every table on the product wears.
 *
 * Sixteen queues had grown their own copy of the same four class strings. The strings
 * agreed — and then one of them learned something the other fifteen did not. The
 * process queue worked out how to round a hovered row; the register kept painting a
 * square band under a rounded header well for weeks, and nothing failed, because a
 * duplicated constant is not a drift a gate can see. This module is the collapse the
 * `register-cases-table` comment promised: the treatment lives once, every table reads
 * it from here, and `check:table-rows` fails the next table that writes its own.
 *
 * ## Why a row's fill lives on its cells
 *
 * `border-radius` is ignored on a `tr` in every engine, and under `border-separate` —
 * which these tables need so the header strip can round itself into a well — a row's
 * own fill paints as a square rectangle *behind* its cells. So a fill on the row can
 * never have corners, however the row is styled. Every state below therefore sends its
 * fill to `[&>td]` and rounds the two end cells, and cancels the DS `TableRow`'s own
 * fill for that state (`hover:bg-transparent` and friends) — otherwise the row's square
 * paints the corners straight back in.
 *
 * Three consequences, each of which cost a round of "why is there still a line there":
 *
 * 1. The hairline a row carries curves with the corner once the cell rounds, so it
 *    fades to transparent while the row is lit.
 * 2. The hairline of the row *above* cuts across the band's top corners. A row cannot
 *    ask about its predecessor, so that rule is reached from the body — which is why
 *    `tableBodyClass` exists and has to be given the same options as the row.
 * 3. `border-radius` is part of what changes, so it is named in the cells' transition
 *    beside the two colours. Leave it out and the corners snap square while the fill is
 *    still fading, and the row leaves a square ghost behind the pointer.
 *
 * ## Which states light a row
 *
 * `hover` and an open row menu (`has-aria-expanded`) are the transient ones and share
 * the `surface-sunken` tone — the warm well the header strip already wears, lighter than
 * `accent`. It was `accent` until the owner found that grey too heavy for a row under the
 * pointer (Sept 11, first answered on the cases table by design's round 2) and chose the
 * lighter tone as the standard, keeping the rounded band (2026-09-11). The open record
 * keeps `accent`, so the row you are looking at stays a step stronger than the one the
 * pointer is passing over. Selection is `accent-strong` and persistent. They are not interchangeable: brand fill means
 * "current / now", never "selected" (ui-craft §2), and a queue whose rows do nothing
 * gets `hover: false` rather than a fill that promises an act it cannot perform.
 *
 * Selection rounds **as a run, not per row**: a row rounds its top only when the row
 * above is not selected and its bottom only when the row below is not, so one pick
 * reads as a band and twelve consecutive picks read as one block with two rounded ends
 * rather than a scalloped stack of pills.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in `components/chrome`
 *
 * The court side must not reach into the citizen side or the reverse, and the queues
 * that share this treatment sit on both — `/employee`'s sixteen and the advocate's
 * `cases-table`. Each side previously kept its own copy rather than import across the
 * boundary, which is a correct instinct about the boundary and the wrong conclusion
 * about the fix. `chrome/` is neither side's, so both can read from it without either
 * becoming the other's parent — the arrangement the old comments kept promising.
 *
 * Every class is written out in full rather than composed from a template, because
 * Tailwind finds utilities by scanning source text: a class assembled at runtime is a
 * class that never reaches the stylesheet.

/**
 * Header cells. The strip is a well inside the panel, so it carries the sunken fill.
 *
 * The label reads at `text-body-compact` (14px), the same size as the data below it, not
 * a step smaller. 12px column headers were the last 12px left in the staff tables, and the
 * owner does not want that size doing label work in the product (2026-09-14). The header
 * still recedes under the data — it is `font-semibold` on the muted ink, over the sunken
 * fill, against foreground-weight body text — so the hierarchy now comes from weight and
 * colour rather than from a size the eye has to squint at.

 */
/**
 * Data cells. `h-16` is the row's floor, and it is the reason a queue reads the same
 * on two screens.
 *
 * Nothing here used to name a height, so a row was as tall as whatever its tallest column
 * happened to hold. Most queues land at 65px by accident: `/employee/hearings/schedule`
 * because its Advocates column stacks two counsel, `sign-process` because the cause title
 * wraps in a 315px column, `/cases` at 77px because it stacks two counsel *and* a chip.
 * Bulk reschedule has no column that stacks anything, so the same table on the same plate
 * collapsed to 46px and read as a different component (owner, 2026-09-17: *"the same
 * information structure — why can't you just match the same height"*).
 *
 * 64px of cell plus the hairline is the 65px the court queues already sit at, so this
 * lifts the short rows and moves nothing else: a row with two lines in any column is
 * already past the floor and stays where it was, `/cases` included.
 *
 * It is `h-16` and not `min-h-16` because this is a table cell. The CSS table model
 * treats a cell's `height` as a *minimum* — the row takes the tallest cell and grows past
 * it for content — while `min-height` on a cell is simply ignored, which is how the first
 * attempt at this floor changed nothing.
