/**
 * A unique identifier, in the one treatment the product gives them: monospaced, with
 * tabular figures, and copyable by clicking the number itself.
 *
 * ## Why these are mono and counts are not
 *
 * `ST 412/2025`, a CNR, a receipt reference, a submission id — these are read character
 * by character and transcribed into other systems, so the eye needs to hold a position
 * in the string. A proportional face closes up the digits and makes `412` and `4l2` the
 * same shape. Counts are not read that way: "3 cases" is a quantity, and monospacing it
 * only makes the sentence it sits in look like a terminal. So the rule the owner set
 * (2026-09-16) is by *kind of fact*, not by "does it contain digits" — identifiers and
 * unique ids get the mono; totals, counts and dates do not.
 *
 * Successive design rounds kept losing the treatment because it lived as a `font-mono`
 * class copied into seventy render sites, any one of which could be rewritten without
 * the others. It lives here now, so losing it again takes a deliberate edit to one file.
 *
 * ## The copy affordance
 *
 * No button beside the value — the value *is* the control. At rest it reads as text; on
 * hover or focus it takes a sunken pill and the copy glyph fades in beside it, which is
 * the signal that it can be taken. The glyph holds no room at rest (owner, 2026-09-21):
 * a reserved box left a hole after every identifier, most visibly mid sentence,
 * "ST 412/2025   · 24×7 ON Court".
 *
 * **In a table it holds no room on hover either.** A table with automatic layout sizes
 * each column to its widest cell, so one cell growing 14px under the pointer widened the
 * whole column for every row and shoved the columns after it sideways (2026-09-23). So
 * inside a `td` the glyph sits out of flow at the value's trailing edge, over the cell's
 * own `px-4`, and the control measures the same in every state. Everywhere else it keeps
 * the push: whatever follows eases aside by the glyph's width while the pointer is on it
 * (owner, 2026-09-24), because out of flow there it landed on top of the next thing, the
 * case header's history icon.
 *
 * Clicking copies and says so twice, at two ranges. On the number itself the glyph
 * becomes a tick for a moment — that is the affordance confirming itself, in place. And
 * a toast carries the value, because the clipboard is system state and taking something
 * into it is the kind of one-off act that deserves a system acknowledgement (owner,
 * 2026-09-16). It names the value rather than the kind — `Copied ST 412/2025` — since
 * with a column of these under the pointer the only thing worth confirming is *which*
 * one you got. Neutral, not success: green claims an operation completed, and this is an
 * acknowledgement. Where the clipboard is unavailable (an insecure origin, a browser
 * that refuses) the component stays exactly as legible, just not clickable.
 *
 * The toast is also the only announcement. Sonner renders its own live region, so the
 * `aria-live` span this used to carry would have read the copy out twice.
 *
 * The hover hint is the native `title`, not the DS `Tooltip`. `Tooltip` needs an ambient
 * `TooltipProvider`, which the advocate shell supplies and the court shell does not — so
 * the styled version threw on every court screen that carried an identifier, and a leaf
 * used in ninety-five files has no business depending on which shell it landed in.

/**
 * Whether this browser will take a copy — `false` on the server and through the first
 * client render.
 *
 * Read straight off `navigator` during render, this component emitted a `span` on the
 * server and a `button` on the client, so every identifier on the page was a hydration
 * mismatch and React threw the subtree away and re-rendered it. `useSyncExternalStore`
 * with a distinct server snapshot is the house answer to exactly that (see
 * `useMinWidth`): the first client render agrees with the server, and the affordance
 * arrives on the pass after hydration. Nothing subscribes — clipboard support does not
 * change while the page is open — so the subscribe function is a no-op.
