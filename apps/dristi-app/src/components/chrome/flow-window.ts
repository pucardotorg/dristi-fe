/**
 * A workflow on a phone is a window, not a modal (lead designer, Sept 21).
 *
 * A form, a signing step or a payment floating as a card over a dimmed page
 * reads as an interruption of the page. On a phone it is the page: it takes the
 * whole screen and arrives from the right, the direction "further in" already
 * means on a phone, and leaves the same way, so the person reads it as the next
 * screen of the thing they tapped. From `sm` up the same dialog stays a dialog.
 *
 * Underneath it is still the DS `Dialog`. A full-screen takeover wants exactly
 * what a dialog gives: focus held inside, the page behind inert, Escape and a
 * close control. Only the surface and the motion change.
 *
 * Motion (Emil Kowalski's tables): occasional tier, purpose spatial consistency.
 * Transform only, no dissolve, because a window that fades reads as an overlay
 * again. 500ms in on the iOS drawer curve, 300ms out along the same path: the curve
 * covers most of the distance in its first third, so at 300ms the owner read
 * it as a jump (Sept 21). A full-screen surface sits at the long end of the
 * drawer range. With
 * reduced motion the travel goes and a short fade stays.
 *
 * Spread the result onto `DialogContent`: `className` last in the call site's
 * `cn`, `style` as is. Both are empty from `sm` up.
