/**

 * switch, a notifications bell and a profile menu; none of the three belongs to the
 * bench. The bell would be a thirteenth live count on a screen whose rail already carries
 * twelve. The switch reads a locale provider that is the citizen shell's and does not
 * exist under `/employee` — what language a Kollam bench works in is a real product
 * question and not one this bar can answer by reaching across the area split. And the
 * person is already named, in full, at the foot of the rail.
 *
 * It runs at every width now, which costs each court screen the bar's height. What it
 * buys back is a rule: the rail's brand row is the bar's own height, so the seam under
 * one and the seam under the other are a single line straight across the viewport, in
 * both rail widths. Before this the rail's header seam ran out into nothing.

/**
 * A crumb link, plus the focus treatment the primitive does not ship.
 *
 * `BreadcrumbLink` carries `transition-colors hover:text-foreground` and nothing for
 * focus, so the only indicator a keyboard user gets is whatever the browser draws,
 * recoloured by the blanket `* { outline-color: … }` in `globals.css` — a colour with no
 * style and no width behind it, and at 50% over the bar's fill it does not reach the 3:1
 * that a focus indicator owes. Every other interactive primitive in the system pairs a
 * full-opacity edge with the translucent halo; this one has neither.
 *
 * That is a gap in the primitive, so the repair is *composed on* rather than edited in —
 * a synced file loses local changes at the next sync and fails the sync gate in between.
 * The recipe is the DS's own for a control with no border of its own to tint: the halo
 * from `Badge`, the full-opacity outline from `TabsTrigger`. `focus-ring` is the named
 * token for the halo, so it is used by name instead of an alpha modifier on `ring`.
 * `rounded-sm` only gives the ring a corner to follow; nothing shows at rest.
 *
 * Filed as request 16 in `docs/design/ds-requests.md` — it wants fixing once, upstream,
 * not at every call site that ever renders a crumb.

 * Shown exactly when the rail is not carrying a fold control of its own.
 *
 * Two clauses, both in CSS. Below `md` the rail has left the layout, so `md:hidden` shows
 * this at every phone width. At `md` and up it comes back only while the rail is folded to
 * a strip, which the page column publishes as a data attribute for this to read
 * (`ChromePageColumn`); the higher-specificity selector is what lets the second clause
 * overturn the first inside the same media query.
 *
 * The rule is CSS and not `useSidebar().isMobile`, even though the rail header gates its
 * own trigger on exactly that. `isMobile` is `false` until an effect has run, so a JS gate
 * here would ship a phone server HTML with no way into the navigation at all and only
 * repair it at hydration — which is what the advocate's bar does today. A media query is
 * right at first paint. Keeping the folded clause on the same mechanism is the point: two

 * The way back into the rail, whenever the rail cannot offer one itself.
 *
 * There must never be two of these on screen, and never none. Four states, one rule:
 *
 * - **Desktop, rail open** — the rail's own header holds the fold control. This hides.
 * - **Desktop, rail folded** — the rail's header gives its control up so the brand mark
 *   can keep the page origin, and this takes over. Shown. It is the advocate's behaviour,
 *   adopted: the composition below is already what that bar does, for the same reason.
 * - **Phone, rail off-canvas** — the rail is not in the layout at all, so this is the
 *   only door to it. Shown.
 * - **Phone, sheet open** — the sheet appends its own close control and Radix hides the
 *   rest of the page from assistive tech behind the scrim, so this one is neither
 *   reachable nor announced while it is up.
 *
 * **One element, not two.** A second element is a second way for the count to come out
 * wrong, and `md` partitions widths rather than states, so the two would have to agree
 * about the fold as well as the breakpoint. `SidebarTrigger` needs no help routing itself:
 * it opens the sheet below `md` and unfolds the rail above it.
 *
 * **The words are the one thing that does branch in JS**, because the two states are not
 * doing the same thing to a listener. On a phone the rail is not on screen at all, so this
 * opens it. Folded, the rail *is* on screen — seven named buttons in a strip — and a
 * listener is told nothing is open; "expand" is what actually happens to it. That read is
 * safe where a visibility gate would not be: `useRailCollapsed` is `false` on the server
 * and on the client's first render alike (the rail always starts open — the DS writes its
 * cookie and never reads it, and `useIsMobile` reports `false` from its server snapshot),
 * so there is nothing here for hydration to disagree about. It is also only a name. What
 * is on screen stays entirely in CSS.

/**
 * The steps above this page, and then this page. `courtTrail` decides what they are; this
 * decides how they survive a narrow bar.
 *
 * **The last step is where you are, so it goes to full ink** — the ordinary trail
 * convention, restored on 2026-09-11 when the trail started carrying the current page
 * (owner). It is the DS `BreadcrumbPage` slot rather than a recoloured span: the
 * primitive is what sets `aria-current="page"` and `aria-disabled`, so a screen reader is
 * told which step is the page and told that it is not a link — neither of which a colour
 * can say. The steps above it stay muted, which is now a real distinction rather than a
 * flat row.
 *
 * **The root is pinned and the rest shrink.** Left to itself flex takes width off every
 * child in proportion, which on the thirteen queue screens means the trail gives up its
 * link — `Court home`, the only route home the court's chrome offers anywhere — to keep a
 * section name legible, and a section is a disclosure in the rail with nowhere to go. The
 * longer the label, the worse the trade, so a translated section name makes it worse
 * rather than better. Pinning the root inverts that: the tail clips first. Clipping costs
 * nothing that matters, because `truncate` shortens a label and never un-links it — on
 * the composer, where the last step is a real link back to the day's list, the target
 * survives the ellipsis.
 *
 * The chevrons are pinned for a different reason: a squashed separator would be worse
 * than a clipped word.
 *
 * Below `md` the middle steps leave outright — but "middle" is not simply "not an end"
 * any more. Now that the trail ends where the reader is, dropping everything but the two
 * ends would take the *way back* off every nested page: a phone would show `Court home`
 * and `CMP/1840/2025`, and the queue the complaint is waiting in — the only route back to
 * it, and the reason the file itself carries no back control — would be the thing that
 * left. So a phone keeps three: the root, the last step that is a link, and the page. On
 * a queue screen there is no such link and it keeps two, which is what it had before.
