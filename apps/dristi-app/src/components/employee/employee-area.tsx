/**
 * The court-staff area wrapper.

 * Court staff do not get the citizen `AppShell` — the rail there is the advocate's product
 * (pending tasks, filings, join a case) and none of it is the bench's. What the two halves
 * of the app *do* share is their chrome, and that now lives in one place:
 * `components/chrome` owns the frame — rail plate, row metrics, bar height, seams — and
 * each area pours its own content into it. `/employee` consumes it here; the advocate's
 * shell migrates onto the same frame next.
 *
 * Two regions, layered the DS way: the charcoal rail down the left, and the white page
 * beside it. The mark sits at the head of the rail, where the page origin is, and the bar
 * runs across the page at every width — see `EmployeeTopBar` for what it carries and what
 * it deliberately does not.
 *
 * `main` is a flex column so a screen that wants to pin a footer (the order composer)
 * can fill the remaining height. Screens that don't opt in still start at the top.
 *
 * There is no sign-in in front of this: `/employee` is the entry point.
