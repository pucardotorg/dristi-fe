/**
 * A dated chain of steps, grouped by phase — the court side's one timeline treatment.
 *
 * It was built for the waiting complaint's file (`register-case-screen.tsx`) and the
 * cause list's case overview now reads the same way (owner, 2026-09-12), so it lives
 * here rather than in either of them. Both screens show the same thing — what happened
 * to this cheque, and what the court has done since — and two copies of that treatment
 * would drift the way sixteen copies of the table row did before `check:table-rows`
 * existed. Nothing here knows which screen it is on.
 *
 * **The measures are gone, and that is the design** (owner, 2026-09-12: *"I'm not
 * understanding what the 84 days means. Like was it 84 days ago?… we just show the
 * timeline directly"*). A span stated as a number of days is a figure the reader has to
 * re-anchor to two events before it means anything. The dates are the anchor, so the
 * dates are what a step shows; the note column is for what a step *means* — the
 * statutory window it closes — and never for restating the arithmetic.
 *
 * The container it sits in must carry `@container`: the three-column split is a
 * container query, so the same group reads correctly in a page panel and in a dialog
 * sheet without either of them knowing the other's width.

 * One step: its name, and its date against the far edge where dates line up. Composed as
 * the item's children because the DS item's own title slot takes a string, and a step's
 * date is a `<time>`.
 *
 * **The spacing between steps lives inside the step, not under it.** The DS item spaces
 * itself with `pb-6` on the `li`, and its rail stretches only to the item's content box —
 * so on the render the line stopped at every step and the gap between them was blank.
 * Moving the spacing into the content makes the rail run through it to the next dot.
 * Upstream DS feedback: the rail should span the item's padding (brief §0.5).
