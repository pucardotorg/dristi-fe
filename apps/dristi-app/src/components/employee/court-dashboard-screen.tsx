/**
 * `/employee` — the bench's working brief.
 *
 * ## What this is, after the fourth pass
 *
 * The owner cut the last version to the studs: the stat cards manufactured urgency with no
 * reason, the bar chart repeated the cards, and the workload panel was the navigation rail
 * printed twice. The instruction was plain — *a dashboard should be to the point and
 * actionable, not show useless things* — with the freedom to decide what actually helps a
 * bench stay on top of its court.
 *
 * So nothing here is a count for its own sake, and nothing restates the rail. Every line
 * is a specific case or a specific decision, and every line **opens**. The screen answers
 * three questions a magistrate opens it to ask, and stops:
 *
 * 1. **What must I act on first?** The cases the law and the higher courts put ahead of
 *    the queue — someone in custody, a disposal deadline running down, a summons whose
 *    service report has not come back — each with the plain reason and the number that
 *    makes it urgent, most pressing at the top. Not a category tile: the actual case,
 *    openable in the register.
 * 2. **What is waiting for my first order?** New complaints that cleared scrutiny and need
 *    cognizance — one decision, surfaced with its count and a way in.
 * 3. **What is out of my hands?** Cases a higher court has stayed or is hearing on appeal
 *    or revision — awareness, so the bench does not proceed on a matter it must not.
 *
 * The day's own sitting is one action in the header, because that is where signing in
 * already lands. There is no distribution chart and no queue mirror: the register holds
 * the whole file, the rail holds the queues, and this holds only what needs a person.
