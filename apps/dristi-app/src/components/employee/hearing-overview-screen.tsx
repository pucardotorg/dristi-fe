 * the sections sit on it as white cards. A `shadow-raised` panel inside a
 * `shadow-modal` sheet is depth spent twice, so the overlay cards stay flat, and
 * the radius steps down with the nesting (ui-craft §4).

 * One listing's case overview — what is in this case, at a glance.

 * Entered from the cause title on today's cause list, and by anyone landing on the
 * URL. **Start hearing no longer comes here.** Calling a matter now opens these same
 * sections in an overlay over the cause list (`hearing-overview-dialog.tsx`), because
 * the bench that has just called item 4 is still working the day's list and should not
 * be taken off it to read the case it is about to hear. The route stays for the other
 * two ways in: reading a matter without calling it, and a link that has to survive a
 * new tab, a bookmark or the back button.
 *
 * The two surfaces are not two compositions. `HearingOverviewSections` is one set of
 * sections rendered on both, dressed for whichever it is on — the peek was retired for
 * showing the same facts a second way, and that is not a mistake worth making twice.
 *
 * **It reads, it does not run the sitting.** End hearing, Pass over and the order
 * composer all stay on the cause list, where the day is. Calling the matter is what
 * got the bench here; the one action this page offers is a way further into the
 * case, and even that is not connected yet (`ViewCaseAction`).
 *
 * **It carries no back control of its own.** The court's chrome already is one: the
 * trail in the top bar ends in Today's hearings, a live link to the list this page
 * was opened from, sticky at every width and cut to its two ends on a phone so the
 * way home survives (`lib/employee/navigation.ts` sets that doctrine out — the trail
 * is the path back, and the page is never a step in it).
 *
 * **View case lives in a pinned band at the foot of the page, right-aligned.** The
 * brief for this screen (`docs/design/proposals/hearing-overview.md`) recommended
 * against a band here and argued for the header slot; the owner read that
 * recommendation in full and decided for the band on 2026-09-06. The call is logged
 * in that file's decision log, and it is why this screen is composed the way it is.
 * The action moved rather than multiplied — the header keeps the caption, the cause
 * title and the status chip, and the page still spends its one teal exactly once.
 * Placement inside the band matches the house sticky-bar recipe used one route
 * along (`order-screen.tsx` `sm:ml-auto`, `sign-orders-screen.tsx` `justify-end`):
 * the primary sits on the trailing edge.
 *
 * The band is the recipe the order composer uses one route along
 * (`order-screen.tsx`): hairline top rule, card fill, no shadow of its own. The page
 * carries pinned chrome at both ends now, and neither end is louder than the other.

 *
 * A full case file has been built, on the citizen side, in the advocate's flows.
 * `/employee` does not read from there (`lib/employee/content.ts`), and there is no
 * court-side case file yet, so wiring this today would either point at a route that
 * 404s or cross the split the two halves of the app are being built either side of.
 * Connecting it is a decision that has been taken and deferred, not one this screen
 * gets to make.
 *
 * So it is a real button that says plainly it goes nowhere — `aria-disabled` rather
 * than `disabled`, so it keeps focus and the tooltip is reachable by keyboard. The
 * same bargain Join VC makes on the cause list. No icon: the label is the whole of it.
 *
 * **Teal only where it is the act.** On this page it is the one thing the band offers,
 * so it takes the page's one primary. In the cause-list overlay it shares the footer
 * with the call on the sitting — a real act, against a promise — so there it steps down
 * to `outline` and the teal goes to Start hearing. One surface, one primary (ui-craft
 * §1.2): a promise and an act cannot both be it, and the act wins.
 *
 * `aria-disabled` is a promise to assistive tech and nothing else: the DS Button
 * hangs its dimming off `:disabled` (`button.tsx`), which this control does not
 * set, so left alone it ships full-strength teal with a live hover and the press
 * translate — it lit up, went down under the finger, and did nothing. Tolerable
 * beside a title; not in a band that means "the act on this page lives here" on a
 * dozen other screens. The three `aria-disabled:` utilities restore the DS's own
 * disabled look (`opacity-50`) and cancel the two states that were lying.
 * Deliberately **not** `pointer-events-none` — the DS pairs that with `:disabled`,
 * and here it would kill the hover that opens the tooltip, which is the one thing
 * explaining why the button is dead.
 *
 * It stays `w-fit` at every width rather than filling the band on a phone. A
 * button stretched edge to edge is not at the right of anything — it is a teal
 * bar pinned under the reading, permanently, on the one control here that goes
 * nowhere. The band still stacks if a second action ever joins it.

 * a hole where its second half should be.

 * sitting for this matter (`lib/employee/hearing-overview.ts`), and this build must
 * not upgrade that into a finding that the court never called it.
