 * One bail bond, read and then signed or refused — the single-bond path off the queue.
 *
 * **One overlay, two stages** (owner, 2026-09-16). Reading is the wide stage: the
 * document *is* the task, so it is a `height="fill"` `DocumentPreview` on the canvas.
 * Signing is the narrow stage: a note saying what is about to be signed, the choice of
 * how, and Submit, in a reading-width column centred in the same window. It was two
 * `Dialog`s until now — see `sign-method-stage.tsx`.
 *
 * **The signature stage is a departure from the reference**, made on the owner's
 * instruction (2026-09-03). The reference took Proceed to sign straight to a Confirm sign
 * modal and asked nothing about how the signature gets on the paper. A bail bond is
 * executed by the accused and the surety before the bench attests it, so "upload the bond
 * they signed" is a real path in a way it is not for an order — which is why this queue
 * follows the forms queue here rather than the orders queue.
 *
 * **Reject** refuses the bond and it leaves the bench unsigned — no reason is asked for,
 * because the reference asks for none and a reasons taxonomy invented for a demo would be
 * inventing product. It sits on the reading stage, where the bench can still see what it
 * is refusing.
 *
 * **Submit signs nothing.** It moves the row's status in the demo queue and closes — see
 * `lib/employee/sign-bail-bonds.ts`. Nothing is written, published or sent, and no e-sign
 * provider is called.
