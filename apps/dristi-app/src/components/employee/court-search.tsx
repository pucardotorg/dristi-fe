/**
 * The court side's search — a spotlight over the page, not a filter inside the rail.
 *
 * The owner's call (2026-09-23): *"it works like a global filter — we have something
 * similar in the advocate flow … it opened a modal in the center of the screen like
 * spotlight search."* That advocate one is `shell/app-search.tsx`, and this is
 * deliberately the same shape — `CommandDialog`, a printed shortcut, ⌘K from anywhere —
 * rather than a second idea about what search looks like in this product.
 *
 * It is **not** the same search. The advocate's reads `useDrafts()`: the filings made in
 * that browser, found by party name and case-file number. Nothing in that store belongs
 * to a court, so pointing the rail at it would find nothing. What this one searches is
 * every destination in the court side — the twenty rows the rail renders — which is what
 * the complaint was actually about: eighteen queues under four families that had to be
 * hunted for by remembering which drawer they lived in. Typing "delay" needs no taxonomy.
 *
 * **Cases are not in it yet, and the gap is deliberate.** Every court queue screen
 * already carries its own "Case name or number" field and `/employee/cases` is the whole
 * register, so a second case search here would be a third place to look — and the owner
 * described the advocate original as *"yet to be fully designed"*, which makes it a
 * pattern to match rather than a spec to copy. When cases do arrive they are a second
 * `CommandGroup` beside these, not a change of shape.
 *
 * The rows come from `navigation.ts`, never a second list: a queue added there is
 * searchable by that edit alone, and the search cannot drift from the rail.
