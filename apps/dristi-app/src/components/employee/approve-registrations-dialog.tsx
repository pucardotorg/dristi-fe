/**
 * One registration request, verified and then approved or rejected — the whole decision,
 * without leaving the queue.
 *
 * Handover `REG-14` says the photograph of the Bar ID card exists **so the scrutiny
 * officer can verify** the typed claim, so the review body is built as that comparison
 * and nothing else: the values on the left, the card on the right, at the same time, one
 * saccade apart.
 *
 * **One overlay, five stages, no dialog on a dialog** (owner, 2026-09-10). Review →
 * Reject or Approve → a settled end state, each stage sliding in from the right and Back
 * sliding the previous one in from the left. Every stage past Review is a **focused**
 * step — one question, centred, nothing else on it — because a step that keeps the whole
 * review layout and drops a control into it does not read as a step at all (owner,
 * 2026-09-11, on the first build's reject stage).
 *
 * **Two shapes hold every fact here, and there is no third** (D19, D20).
 *
 * 1. `FactRow` — a term and its value, in a `DescriptionList`. Request metadata, the four
 *    submitted attributes, every rejection round.
 * 2. `ComparisonBlock` — a `Table` with a column per source. Anything where two values
 *    disagree.
 *
 * That division is the whole of the 2026-09-11 rebuild. The build before it decorated a
 * value with everything that could be said about it — two chips, a muted source line, a
 * struck-through previous value — and the owner read the result on the render as
 * *"an abomination of just information being thrown around with no particular
 * hierarchy"*. A comparison is not a decoration on a value; it is a table, and a table is
 * what tables are for. If you find yourself adding a fourth treatment inside a row, the
 * fact belongs in a table of its own.
 *
 * **The register only speaks when it disagrees** (D19). No `matches`, no `OTP: verified`.
 * See `registerAnswer` for why agreement is not information.
 *
 * **Approve and Reject perform no act.** Both drop the row from the demo queue — see
 * `lib/employee/approve-registrations.ts`. No account is opened, no access is granted or
 * refused, no reason is sent and nobody is told, and the end states say so once.

/**
 * The act, and having acted — **one card, in one place**.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-11: *"the two approval screens or rejection screens feel redundant to me.
 * Is there any way to optimize it better, where it's not two steps but feels like one
 * step? Maybe masking it with motion."* And, of the settled state: *"it looks a little dull
 * and sad"*, and of the rejection: *"too alarming with the red big header, bold text and
 * everything. Tone it down, don't make it dramatic. Just clean, minimal, crafted."*
 *
 * Both notes are answered by the same move: **the confirmation and the outcome are the
 * same object.** The card is built once for the scene (`SCENE`) and survives the act, so
 * pressing Confirm does not replace a screen with another screen. What happens is that the
 * strip across its top resolves — from a neutral "You are approving" to a tinted "Account
 * created" — the body settles from a control into a record, and the card takes the raised
 * shadow it had only borrowed on hover. Nothing translates, nothing unmounts, and the
 * officer's eye never has to find its place again.
 *
 * The strip is also where the drama went. A settled state used to open with a 48px disc
 * and a title-size line in destructive ink, centred: an interstitial for a decision this
 * officer takes forty times a day. The status now lives in a 16px mark and one line of
 * body text on a pale tint — the DS's muted treatment, doing what a muted treatment is
 * for. The semantics the owner asked for the round before (green for approved, red for
 * rejected) are all still there; only their volume changed.
