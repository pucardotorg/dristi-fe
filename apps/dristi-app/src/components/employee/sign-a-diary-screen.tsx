/**
 * Sign A-Diary — the court's own register of its day, waiting for the signature that
 * makes it a record.
 *
 * The same screen as its siblings in the rail: the page title stands on the page, and
 * **one** lifted panel holds the filter, the table and the pagination footer together.
 * Same panel recipe, same `gap-6` / `p-6`, same table treatment, literally the same
 * footer component. A bench moving between the rail's rows is looking at one court's
 * work through several windows and should not have to re-learn the furniture in between.
 *
 * Three things make this one different, and all three come from what an A-Diary is:
 *
 * - **It is read a day at a time.** The one filter is a date, and it opens on the day the
 *   court is sitting, as the reference draws it. There is no "every day": the register is
 *   dated paper, and Clear returns to today rather than pouring three days into a table
 *   whose columns cannot tell them apart.
 * - **There is no bulk act.** The reference gives this queue no checkboxes, and it is
 *   right to: the two signing queues above it sign papers the court has already
 *   finished, while signing the diary means reading what was written and correcting it
 *   first. So there is no selection and no sticky bar, and the screen's one strong action
 *   is the reference's own teal Search.
 * - **The record is editable until it is signed.** That lives in the entry dialog, beside
 *   the words it changes.
 *
 * **Nothing on this screen signs, records or files anything.** Saving replaces a string
 * in the demo register and signing drops the entry from it — see
 * `lib/employee/sign-a-diary.ts`.
