 * The grammar a raised item is read in — one label column, one value column, rows only
 * where they apply.
 *
 * It lives here rather than inside the field row because two surfaces render the same
 * item: the record in the workbench, and the summary in the send-back dialog. Those are
 * one data type, so they get one rendering (ui-craft §2) — an officer who has learnt to
 * scan "FSO's value / Filed value / Annotation" down the left edge reads the dialog
 * without learning anything new, however many items it holds.
 *
 * The two columns collapse to one below `22rem` of container width, so a record stays
 * legible when the fields pane is dragged to its floor. `@container` is declared by the
 * caller, on whatever box actually constrains the rows.
