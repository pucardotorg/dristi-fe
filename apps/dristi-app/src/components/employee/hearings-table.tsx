/**
 * Start hearing and End hearing live in the Action column, as one labelled outline
 * control — not teal (Join VC is the screen's one primary). Both are buttons: Start
 * marks the listing ongoing and opens that matter over the list; End marks it
 * completed. Neither leaves the day.
 *
 * It is the only bordered action on a callable row (ui-craft §2). Scheduled listings
 * start; the same slot ends the one that is ongoing. Completed listings have nothing
 * left to call, so the control stops taking a press — the same outline slot now
 * reads *Hearing ended*, disabled. A dash would read as missing data; the words say
 * the call is done. It stays the outline dress (not a second status chip) so the
 * Completed chip remains the one status mark (ui-craft §1.4). Passed-over listings
 * also have nothing left to call today; the slot empties rather than showing that
 * report, because the call was not finished — the Passed over chip is the mark.
 *
 * Pass over is the other sitting outcome, not a second session verb: it lives
 * in a row overflow beside this control, on scheduled and ongoing rows only.
 *
 * **All of it belongs to the seat that runs the sitting.** A seat that does not gets no
 * slot at all, not a quieter one: this used to hand the typist a one-control version
 * that reported the sitting in three words, and three words for what the Status chip
 * two cells away already said is a column of nothing (owner, 2026-09-09). That seat's
 * cause list ends at Orders, and the trip into the order is what moves the matter
 * (`canTypeOrder`).
 *
 * `min-w-32` is a floor, not a fit: "Start hearing" measures 83px of ink and "End
 * hearing" / "Hearing ended" sit inside the same width, so 128px holds any of those
 * labels with room and neither the control nor the column jumps when the word
 * changes. It was `min-w-40`, which spent 45px per row on nothing and pushed the
 * table past the width of its own panel — see below.

/**
 * The two right-hand columns are ordinary columns. They used to be pinned, and the pin
 * is what the bench read as a rendering fault.
 *
 * `sticky right-0` does not mean "hold still until scrolled past". It clamps the cell's
 * right edge to the scrollport's, so the moment the table is wider than the port the
 * cell is pulled *left*, over its neighbours, at scroll position zero — before anyone
 * has scrolled anything. Action covered Orders. Pinning Orders as well moved the same
 * collision one column left onto Status, where an opaque cell sliced the status chip
 * mid-word; pinning Status would have moved it onto Purpose. The pin was the bug, and
 * no pinning order was going to fix it.
 *
 * Measured on the render, and the numbers are the point. The panel is the viewport less
 * 385px with the rail open and less 193px folded. The table wanted 1182px, against
 * 1127px of panel at a 1512 viewport and 1055px at 1440 — past the threshold at every
 * laptop width this court has, which is why a chip that was in fact always clipped read
 * as an intermittent fault. Trimming the session control to its label (above) and the
 * action cell to its contents brings the table to 1086px, which fits outright from
 * about a 1471 viewport with the rail open, and from 1280 with it folded. Narrower than
 * that it scrolls, and the last column is cut at the port's own edge — which reads as
 * more to the right, where the same content covered mid-table read as broken. No cell
 * overlaps another at any width now, so the class of bug is gone rather than moved.
 *
 * `w-52` is the action group at the control metric — the session control's `min-w-32`,
 * the overflow trigger's `size-10`, one `gap-2` between them, and the cell's `px-4`.
 * `w-18` is the orders icon button plus that same padding.
 *
 * In a seat with no session controls the Action column is not rendered at all, so the
 * same table asks 878px and Orders is the last column. That fits inside the panel at
 * every laptop width this court has, rail open or folded — the scroll, and the last
 * column's cut edge with it, is the bench's case only.

 * unmounting for a move made inside it. Reading item 4 is such a move — the reader wants
 * to know what is in the matter before it is called, and then wants the day back. That
 * is a dismissal, not a trip through the trail.
 *
 * Reading a case and calling it are still two different acts, and that is now the only
 * difference between them: this one opens the same overlay **without marking the
 * listing ongoing**. The chip in the overlay's header therefore says what the row said —

 * asks for). The route survives underneath for a bookmark or a typed URL; no control
 * hands one out any more.

 * underline on the *row's* hover — and this is now one of them rather than the one

             absorbed rather than paid for. The slot does not move when the state changes
             to the filled destructive, whose own edge is a transparent 1px.

             **The hover is the brand's own tint, not the neutral one.** The outline
             variant hovers to `accent` with `text-foreground`, which on a teal-edged
             button drops the label to near-black and leaves the border stranded — the
             control loses its identity at the one moment the reader is pointing at it
             (owner, 2026-09-12). Keeping the teal label over `accent` was not the fix
             either: brand solid measures 4.31:1 on that fill and would have put a
             sub-AA label under every pointer on the board.
             So the fill moves to the brand instead of the neutral, and the label takes
             that fill's own ink — the pairing the Laws ask for on any tinted surface,
             never grey-on-colour. It measures 5.83:1 in light and 8.07:1 in dark, both
             better than the 4.90:1 the label sits at when at rest. `dark:hover:` is
             restated because the variant carries its own `dark:hover:bg-accent`, which
             would otherwise win the cascade in dark and put brand ink back on a neutral.

             `text-primary` is the brand's only text role: the status families each name
             an ink (`success-ink`, `warning-ink`) and brand names none, so this is what

 * the old cause list drew a document-with-plus, and the plus was the wrong half of it:
 * `file-plus` is already this app's mark for *start a new filing* — the rail's File a
 * case row and the filing dashboard's own card both use it — so one glyph meant two
 * things, and on a court screen the one it did not mean was "open this matter's order".
 * A sheet of text is what an order is, and it stays true in every state the control has:
 * drafting one, and opening the finished one the typist lands on.
 *
 * It is deliberately not `gavel`. That reads "judicial order" fastest to an eye raised
 * on American courtrooms, and Indian courts do not use gavels — this is a Kerala
 * district court. It is also already the court home's own mark, where it means the court
 * itself. `stamp` was the near miss: an order does go out under seal, and it is the only
 * candidate that is not another variation on a sheet. It sits in the signing vocabulary
 * already (the Sign evidence empty state), which is what decided it (owner, 2026-09-12).
 *
 * The column header carries the noun, so the glyph's whole job is not to lie.
 *
 * **Once the sitting is over the mark says the order is in** (owner, 2026-09-12): the
 * sheet gains a tick and goes `success-ink`, so a clerk scanning the column can see
 * which matters have their order without opening any of them. Before that the column
 * said only whether the control was pressable, and a heard matter looked exactly like
 * one still waiting to be called.
 *
 * **`completed` is the honest test, not a stand-in for one.** The composer opens on a
 * written order exactly when the sitting is over and on an empty one otherwise
 * (`initialOrderDraft`) — so in this build the order *is* where the status says it is,
 * and this reads the same fact that screen does rather than guessing at it from the
 * chip. The day that stops being true — an order drafted before the sitting ends, or a
 * matter heard with none written — the test has to move to the draft store
 * (`order-drafts.ts`), and this is the one line that has to change.
 *
 * Three carriers, because a green glyph alone would be none for most readers: the
 * colour, the tick (greyscale- and colour-blind-safe) and the accessible name. Colour is
 * never the only one (`ACCESSIBILITY.md`).
 *
 * It is keyed to the listing and not to the seat, because the fact is about the matter:
 * the typist's board shows the same mark on the same rows. What stays seat-shaped is
 * *when the control opens*, below.
 *
 * **When it opens depends on the seat, because what has to happen first does.** For a
 * seat that runs the sitting the control follows the sitting: a matter nobody has called
 * yet has no hearing to pass an order in, so on a scheduled row the icon holds the
 * column disabled and Start hearing beside it is what opens it (`canDraftOrder`). The
 * typist has no such control — this column is that seat's whole row — so there the trip
 * into the order is itself the sitting and a listing still on the day's call opens
 * (`canTypeOrder`). Both seats still close on a listing that was never heard.
 *
 * Disabled by the DS `disabled` prop rather than an `aria-disabled` mark, because this
 * is a live precondition and not a missing build — the same distinction as Sign selected
 * forms with nothing ticked.
 *
 * The reason lives in the accessible name: an icon-only control has no room to
 * carry it, and a tooltip cannot be hovered through the DS's
 * `disabled:pointer-events-none`. It names the status's own reason rather than the
 * seat's, because that is what a reader is being told about — a scheduled row is
 * waiting on the call, and a passed-over one is not going to get one today. Sighted
 * readers get it from the row: the chip and the start control sit inches away.
 *
 * `onOpen` is the caller's chance to act on the trip itself. The cause list uses it for
 * the typist, where walking into the order is what moves the matter; for the bench it is
 * not supplied and opening the composer changes nothing.
 *
 * `named` is for the one place the icon has nothing to lean on. In the table the column
 * header says *Orders* and the glyph is read under it; on a phone row there is no header,
 * and in the typist's seat this is the row's only control — a bare glyph with the name
 * only in `aria-label` leaves a sighted reader guessing at the one act the row has
 * (`ACCESSIBILITY.md` §8). So there it takes the session slot's dress and the words
 * instead: outline, text-only, at the control metric.

           `destructive-muted-foreground` — so the glyph measures 4.54:1 on its own fill in
           light and 7.75:1 in dark, and the hover comes with it rather than being invented.
           Applied as classes rather than by switching the button to `variant="destructive"`

           added; the variant would also have swapped the focus ring for the destructive
           one, which says "this press destroys something" about a press that opens a draft.

           The glyph changes with it: a page with a pen on it (owner, 2026-09-15), which is
           the one of the three that says *being written* rather than naming a state you
           have to already know. So the column reads without the plate too — three glyphs,
           one per state — and the plate is emphasis on the one state that wants it rather
           than the only thing carrying it. A mark that needs its colour to be read is a
           mark that fails for the reader who cannot see the colour (ACCESSIBILITY §3).

           *Noted for the owner, once:* red here is the destructive family, and a draft is
           unfinished rather than wrong. The mark is unmistakable, which is what was asked
           for, and this is the one place the word for the state disagrees with its colour.

           Recorded keeps `success-ink` and no plate — it reports an outcome, and two
           plates in one column would stop either of them meaning anything. */
