/**
 * Sign orders — the orders this bench has drawn up and not yet signed.
 *
 * Deliberately the same screen as the signing queue for forms one row above it in the
 * rail, and as the three review queues before that: the page title stands on the page,
 * and **one** lifted panel holds the filters, the table and the pagination footer
 * together. Same panel recipe, same `gap-6` / `p-6`, same table treatment, same empty
 * states, literally the same footer component. A bench moving between the rail's rows is
 * looking at one court's work through several windows, and should not have to re-learn
 * the furniture in between.
 *
 * What this screen adds is the act. Signing is the one court-side job the reference does
 * in bulk, so selection lives in the table and the commit lives in a sticky bar — the
 * shape `BulkRescheduleScreen` already established for an act committed once over a list
 * longer than a screen. Clicking a row (the case name, or anywhere but the checkbox)
 * opens the order first, the way Sign forms does, because a bench that cannot read what
 * it is signing should not be offered a signature. Sign and publish then asks how — e-sign
 * or upload — the same second step the forms queue already runs.
 *
 * The status filter opens on Pending signature, as the reference draws it: the bench
 * comes here to clear work. Signed orders stay reachable through the same filter rather
 * than disappearing, so an order signed last month can be read without leaving.
 *
 * **Two tabs, because an order has a life before this queue** (owner, 2026-09-16). What
 * is waiting for a signature is only half of what the bench has drawn up: the other half
 * is being written at today's sitting, in the order composer, and until now it was
 * reachable only by going back to the cause list and finding the right row. So the screen
 * splits — the signing queue it has always been, and the day's open drafts beside it —
 * and opens on the queue, because that is what the rail sends the bench here for.
 *
 * The strip is composed the way `SignProcessScreen` composes its stages one row below in
 * the rail, and for the same reason: the tab is the *screen's* question, so it stands
 * above the panel and each tab's panel holds its own controls. Nothing above the strip
 * moves when the tab changes but the line that describes it, and no control is left
 * standing over a list it cannot narrow — the status filter belongs to the signing queue
 * and there is nothing for it to say about a draft.
 *
 * **Nothing is signed, published or sent.** Both signing paths only move a row's status
 * in the demo queue (`lib/employee/sign-orders.ts`), and the drafts tab lists work in
 * progress without acting on it — the way to finish a draft is the composer it came from
 * (`lib/employee/draft-orders.ts`).

          The `key` is not decoration. `DatePicker` treats `value === undefined` as "I am
