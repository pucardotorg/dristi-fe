/**
 * One day of the A-Diary as a table: the case, what the court did, and when it comes
 * back.
 *
 * Three columns, the reference's own, and the narrowest table on the court side. It reads
 * that way because the register itself does: a diary is not a list of cases with facts
 * hung off them, it is a list of *what was done*, and the business of the day is the row.
 * So the business takes the width, carries the row's emphasis and is the only opener —
 * the cause title, the stage, who appeared and the rest of the case's particulars are in
 * the entry the bench opens, where they are read once rather than scanned down a column.
 *
 * **The cause title is not a fourth column here**, though every other court-side queue
 * leads with it. The bench is signing its own day: the number is the register's index
 * and the business is what it is checking, and a party name between them would push the
 * one cell that matters off the right of a laptop. It heads the entry dialog instead.
 *
 * **The business is clamped to two lines, not truncated away.** A day's proceedings run
 * to a paragraph, and a column that grew to fit the longest one would leave four
 * one-line rows floating in it. The full text is in the button's accessible name and in
 * the entry the button opens, so nothing is only available to a sighted reader who can
 * hover (ACCESSIBILITY §7, §10).
 *
 * Cells align to the top rather than the middle, which is the one place this table
 * departs from the shared treatment: a number centred against a two-line paragraph
 * floats, and a register is read across its first line.
 *
 * There is no actions column and no row menu. Signing is the act, it lives on the entry
 * the row opens, and drawing a kebab for it would be furniture around a hole.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table is
 * one panel rather than a box inside a box.
