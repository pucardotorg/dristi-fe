/**
 * One deposition, read and then signed — the single-sheet path off the evidence queue.
 *
 * The document *is* the task, so the dialog is the document: a `height="fill"`
 * `DocumentPreview` filling the stage of a tall `StagedOverlay`, the same layout
 * `SignOrderDialog`, `SignFormDialog` and `ReschedulingRequestDialog` already use to
 * read a court paper before acting on it. The reference draws this screen's overlay as
 * the sheet and nothing else, and it is right to: evidence is long, and the bench
 * signing it is certifying that this is what the witness said.
 *
 * One step rather than the two the forms queue needs. A form is signed by a *party*, so
 * that dialog has to ask how — e-sign, or upload the paper they signed. A deposition is
 * signed by the bench that is already logged in, so the act is one button under the
 * document it acts on, as it is for orders.
 *
 * Download is not repeated in the footer. The document's own frame carries Download and
 * Full view in its strip, and the same control twice in one dialog is one too many.
 *
 * **Signing signs nothing.** It drops the sheet from the demo queue and closes — see
 * `lib/employee/sign-witness-deposition.ts`. Nothing is written, published, sent or
 * filed, and no e-sign provider is called.
