/**
 * **Add signature — a stage of the window that was reading the paper, not a second
 * window.**
 *
 * The four single-document queues (orders, forms, process, bail bonds) each open one
 * overlay on one paper: the bench reads it, then says how it will sign it. Until now
 * those were two `Dialog` roots — the document closed itself, and the method choice
 * opened from its `onCloseAutoFocus` once Radix had finished the exit, so that the second
 * one arrived with an entrance of its own.
 *
 * That was the right complaint and the wrong cure. The jump it was avoiding was real: the
 * box went from the document's width and height to a narrow box in a single frame, with
 * no entrance at all. But the registrations overlay had already answered exactly that
 * inside one window — chrome that holds still, a stage that travels, and a frame that does
 * not resize under the reader — and the owner has since ruled the second modal out
 * altogether (2026-09-16: *"right now it abruptly changes to a new modal — that shouldn't
 * happen at all, everything should happen in one modal with all those
 * motion+interaction"*). So the overlay now keeps the size the document asked for and the
 * signature travels in from the right inside it.
 *
 * It stays **one** shared component, which is the reason the choice is identical wherever
 * one paper is being signed: a bench asked for its signature two different ways in one
 * morning is the drift this prevents. Only the noun, the sentence above the choice, the
 * warning under it and the download differ, and each queue passes its own.

 * A single column at reading width, centred in the canvas while there is room for it —
 * the queues' overlay is as tall as the document needed, and a form pinned to the top of
 * that much air reads as the leftovers of the stage before it. `my-auto` rather than
 * `justify-center` on the scroller: auto margins give way to overflow, so a stage taller
 * than the window still starts at the top and stays reachable.
 *
 * **No card under it**, which is a departure from the other staged overlays and a
 * measured one. Every part of this stage already carries its own edge — the info banner,
 * the `bg-card` choice pills, the bordered code boxes, the dashed drop target — so there
 * is no unbordered muted box for the Laws to object to. And the width does not survive
 * one: at 375px the panel is 343px, the canvas takes 16px a side and a card would take
 * 16px more, leaving 279px for a row of six 40px code boxes and five 8px gaps, which
 * needs 280px. The e-sign step would overflow its own window by a pixel.
