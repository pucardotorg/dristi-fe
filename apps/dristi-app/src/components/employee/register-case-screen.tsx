/**
 * Register cases — one waiting complaint, as the magistrate reads it before taking it on
 * the register or sending it back to scrutiny.
 *
 * The third build, and the only one: the first two are deleted (owner, 2026-09-12). The
 * second was a column of eight identical cards, three screens tall, every date stated
 * twice, forty per cent of the canvas empty. This one is composed around two questions
 * the owner put — *what does the complaint say*, and *how did it get here* — across the
 * full width, in two tiers on one column grid (brief §0).
 *
 * - **Synopsis** is one sheet of six compartments in the owner's order — parties, cheque,
 *   dishonour, demand notice, cause of action, prayer — divided by hairlines, each fact a
 *   label over its value. No dates: those are the timeline's.
 * - **Scrutiny** — who cleared it, how many rounds, how long; the rounds themselves open
 *   as a timeline of send-backs, so a file that went round four times costs no room here.
 * - **Timeline** — the dates, directly: the §138 chain, then the court's steps under it,
 *   one rail after another, each row a step, what it means, and the day it closed.
 *
 * Every value comes from `lib/employee/case-review.ts` through one slot; every term from
 * its declared lists. Colour appears only where the file is outside a limit or another
 * complaint is pending. 14px throughout; 12px only for the three panel eyebrows.
 *
 * Two acts and no third (owner, 2026-09-11). Both progress in place — the body gives way
 * to one card, the header stays, and confirming settles that same card into its outcome.
 * Nothing is performed, and the settled state says so once.
