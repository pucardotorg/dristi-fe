/**
 * One listing's order draft, from the store that outlives the composer.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` over a provider for the same reason `useHearingSession` uses
 * one: the store has to survive the navigation that Next item performs, and the
 * composer is what unmounts on the way. The server snapshot is the same empty map the
 * module starts at, so first paint and hydration agree and there is nothing to
 * suppress.
 *
 * The whole map is the snapshot — selecting a key here would mint a new object on
 * every read and defeat the identity comparison.
 *
 * `initial` is what this listing opens on before anybody has dictated: the empty draft
 * for most of the board, and the written order for a listing the bench has finished
 * (`lib/employee/order-demo.ts`). It must be **stable across renders** — the caller
 * memoises it — because it is this hook's return value until the first edit, and a new
 * object every render would restart everything downstream that watches the draft.
 * It is handed to the store as well as read from it, so an edit is applied to the draft
 * the screen was actually showing.

/**
 * Every draft in this sitting, for a screen that asks *which* listings have one.
 *
 * The cause list needs the map rather than one listing's draft: it draws a mark per row
 * and there is no hook-per-row to read. Same store, same subscription, so the table and
 * the composer cannot disagree about what has been dictated on.
 *
 * **A key here means the typist actually entered something.** `useOrderDraft` writes only
 * through `setDraft`, never on mount, so opening a composer and leaving without touching
 * it records nothing — which is what makes this a safe test for "there is work in
 * progress here" rather than "somebody looked at it". It is also *not* the same question
 * as "would this listing open with text": a completed listing opens on a written order
 * out of `order-demo.ts` with no key in this map (D23).
 *
 * It dies on a reload, like everything else in this store.
