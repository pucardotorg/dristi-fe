/**
 * One day's entry, read, corrected, and then signed.
 *
 * The reference titles this overlay "View Document", and it is the one place the
 * reference undersells its own screen: the bench does not come here to view the diary,
 * it comes here to *make* it. Three things happen in this dialog and they are in the
 * order the register is made — read the day's record, correct the words, sign it — so
 * the overlay is laid out as those three and titled for the entry rather than for the
 * furniture. Sentence case is a DS Law in any case, so "View Document" could not have
 * survived unchanged (deviation logged in the build report).
 *
 * **The correction and the paper sit side by side** (owner, 2026-09-14). Stacked — the
 * document above, the editor below — the overlay had to divide one 85dvh column three
 * ways, and the document got what the editor and the footer left it: a court paper
 * arrived at the bench as a 300px slot you scrolled a heading at a time. Beside each
 * other, the two share the stage's full height, and the paper is read in one go.
 *
 * The split is 2:3 with the document on the right, for the same reason
 * `ApproveRegistrationsDialog` splits 3:2 the other way: width goes to whichever column
 * keeps gaining from it. There the facts were tables and the evidence one landscape
 * scan; here the editor is one field that stops needing width at a comfortable measure,
 * and the document is a portrait page with an appearance table in it. Each column
 * scrolls on its own above `lg`; below it the stage is one scroll with the whole paper
 * laid out in it, because a narrow window cannot hold a panel, a document and a footer
 * at once — and a court paper squeezed into half of one reads worse than a stacked one.
 *
 * The two acts, each beside the thing it acts on: **Save** belongs to the business of
 * the day and sits in that panel; **Sign** is what the dialog exists for and sits in the
 * footer, the one teal action in view.
 *
 * **The paper is the order the court passed that day** (owner, 2026-09-15), not a second
 * rendering of the register line. A diary entry is signed against the day it records, and
 * what that day produced is an order — so the frame holds an order sheet, built on the one
 * the order composer prints. See `ADiaryOrderFacsimile`.
 *
 * **The paper shows what is saved, not what is being typed.** The order's operative
 * passage is the recorded business and the editor holds the draft, so Save is a visible
 * act — the document changes under it — rather than a button whose effect has already
 * happened. The two can be one field because an order sheet's composed passage *is* the
 * business of the day.
 *
 * **Signing takes the field as it stands.** A bench that corrected the wording and went
 * straight for the signature meant to sign the correction, not to lose it, so Sign
 * records the draft with the signature and the note beside it says so. There is no
 * confirmation step and no dead end: the alternative — refusing to sign while an edit is
 * unsaved — is a disabled primary the bench has to decode.
 *
 * Download is not repeated below. `DocumentPreview` carries Download and Full view in
 * its own frame, and the same control twice in one dialog is one too many — the
 * reference's own "Download Document" link is that frame (deviation logged).
 *
 * The preview is the quiet framed variant: a title strip with the two actions in it and
 * the page under the rule. Its default header would name the document and restate the
 * date a few pixels under the dialog's own heading and sub-line, which is one heading
 * too many and one date twice.
 *
 * **Nothing here signs, records or files anything.** Save replaces a string in the demo
 * register and Sign drops the entry from it — see `lib/employee/sign-a-diary.ts`.

/**
 * The order the court passed that day, as paper.
 *
 * **What the bench came to check** (owner, 2026-09-15). The frame used to hold the
 * register page — the same four facts, the appearance table, the business under a
 * heading. But a diary entry is signed against the day it records, and what that day
 * produced is an order; a bench reading its register back needs the order in front of
 * it, not a second rendering of the sentence it is already correcting in the panel.
 *
 * So the page is built on the order sheet the order composer prints (`order-screen.tsx`)
 * rather than on a shape of its own: the court, the cause and the date, the offence every
 * case here is prosecuted for, the order's own title, who appeared, the operative
 * passage, and the block that signs it. Two screens that both draw an order must draw the
 * same one.
 *
 * Three things it keeps from the register page it replaced, and each for a reason:
 *
 * - **The appearance table.** The reference's own drawing, and the part of the day's
 *   record that says the hearing happened at all. The order composer's page states the
 *   same fact as two rolls; here it is already a table the owner has approved, and a
 *   bordered table is what a court paper puts appearances in.
 * - **The operative passage is `entry.business`** — the very string the editor corrects.
 *   That is what keeps Save a visible act: the paper changes under it. An order sheet's
 *   composed passage *is* the business of the day, which is why the two can be one field.
 * - **The paper tokens.** This is a facsimile of a court paper inside a document frame,
 *   not a product surface, so the table and the heading are drawn with the paper palette
 *   rather than the DS `Table` — the same treatment `SignOrderDialog` gives its order.
