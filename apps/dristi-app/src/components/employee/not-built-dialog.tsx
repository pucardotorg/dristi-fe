/**
 * The honest end of a row whose next screen is not built yet.
 *
 * Every court-side list opens the thing it names — a scrutiny, a case file, an order to
 * sign. Where that destination does not exist yet, the row used to be left inert: no
 * hover, no cursor, a line that reads as dead. The owner's call (2026-09-15) is the other
 * way round — the row stays clickable like every other, and lands here, on a plain "not
 * built yet" end state, so what is missing is *stated* rather than hidden behind a row
 * that quietly does nothing.
 *
 * It is a dialog because most court detail views are (`approve-copy`, the sign queues,
 * `delay-condonation`…): the row keeps the same `onOpen` interaction its built siblings
 * use, and the only difference is what it opens. When the real screen is built, the row
 * swaps this for it and nothing else about the list changes.
