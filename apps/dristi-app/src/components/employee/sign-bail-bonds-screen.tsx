/**
 * Sign bail bonds — the bonds executed in this court and not yet signed by the bench.
 *
 * Deliberately the same screen as the signing queues above it in the rail, and as the
 * three review queues before those: the page title stands on the page, and **one** lifted
 * panel holds the search, the table and the pagination footer together. Same panel
 * recipe, same `gap-6` / `p-6`, same table treatment, same empty states, literally the
 * same footer component and the same shared confirmation. A bench moving between the
 * rail's rows is looking at one court's work through several windows, and should not have
 * to re-learn the furniture in between.
 *
 * What it does *not* borrow is the sibling's filter row. The reference gives this queue
 * one control — the case — and no status, date or type filter, so there is one field here
 * and Clear search returns the screen to the whole queue. A bond signed or rejected leaves
 * the list rather than staying behind a status this screen has no control to reach.
 *
 * Signing is the one court-side job the reference does in bulk, so selection lives in the
 * table and the commit lives in a sticky footer — `SignEvidenceScreen`'s recipe, and
 * persistent for its reason: a bar that materialises on the first tick shifts the row the
 * bench just clicked. Both paths end at the same Add signature step — e-sign, or upload
 * the bond the litigant and surety put their hands to — so the bench cannot be asked for
 * a signature two different ways. The bulk path confirms the count first, because those
 * bonds have not been read; the single path has just shown the document instead.
 *
 * The case name of each row opens the bond first, because a bench that cannot read what it
 * is signing should not be offered a signature.
 *
 * **Nothing is signed, published or refused.** Every path only moves a row's status in the
 * demo queue — see `lib/employee/sign-bail-bonds.ts`.
