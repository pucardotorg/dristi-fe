/**
 * Confirming a bulk act — the one dialog every court-side signing queue uses.
 *
 * The four single-act queues each grew their own version of this moment: two of them an
 * `AlertDialog` asking a one-line question, two of them a two-step `Dialog` that went on
 * to ask how the bench would sign. Four confirmations for one act, each phrased
 * differently, is four chances for the bench to read the same button as meaning
 * different things. This is that moment, once — and since the process line added three
 * acts on one screen, the verb is a parameter (`SignBulkAct`) while the shape is not.
 *
 * Two stages, and the second is the point of the dialog. Pressing Sign commits and
 * *stays* — the overlay settles into its outcome instead of vanishing and leaving the
 * bench to infer from a shorter list that anything happened. A single Done dismisses it.
 *
 * **And it now settles rather than swaps.** Until this pass the header, the body and the
 * footer all lived inside the step conditional, so one press replaced every pixel of the
 * window in a single frame with no movement at all — the abruptness the owner ruled out
 * for every court-side modal (2026-09-16: *"everything should happen in one modal with
 * all those motion+interaction"*). Three things were doing it, and the shared frame
 * (`StagedOverlay`) fixes all three: the chrome holds still on both stages, the window
 * keeps its height, and the outcome resolves in the card it was signed in.
 *
 * **What that cost, and why the confirmation is still the product's confirmation.** The
 * old ending was a detached solid success panel carrying its own heading and a 40px tick
 * chip, with the facts in a sunken well beneath — the shape the advocate side ends a
 * submission on (`cases/add-signature-dialog.tsx`), adopted on 2026-09-15 because a bulk
 * act and a submission must not end on two different kinds of object. That ruling stands
 * and the object holds: solid success fill, a tick, and the facts directly under it.
 * What changed is that the fill is the top band of the card those facts were already in
 * rather than a panel that replaces the window, the tick is the mark a band can carry
 * rather than a chip as tall as the band itself, and the heading is the header's —
 * because the header is still there, and two headings stating one outcome is one too
 * many. `bulk-reschedule-screen.tsx` made the same trade first; this is its sibling.
 *
 * A `Dialog` rather than an `AlertDialog`: the flow no longer ends on the decision, and
 * an alert has neither a second stage nor a close affordance.
 *
 * The bulk path asks for no signature method. Choosing between e-sign and an upload is a
 * question about *one* document the bench has read; the queues' single-document paths
 * still ask it, and this path — where nothing was opened — no longer does.
 *
 * `onConfirm` runs each screen's own demo act, which drops the rows from its queue.
