/**
 * One order, read and then signed — the single-order path off the signing queue.
 *
 * **One overlay, two stages** (owner, 2026-09-16). Reading is the wide stage: the
 * document *is* the task, so it is a `height="fill"` `DocumentPreview` on the canvas.
 * Signing is the narrow stage: what is about to be signed, the choice of how, and Submit,
 * in a reading-width column centred in the same window. The window itself does not move —
 * same width, same height, the header and footer standing still while the stage travels
 * in from the right and back from the left.
 *
 * It was two `Dialog`s until now, closed and opened in sequence so the second played an
 * entrance. See `sign-method-stage.tsx` for why that was the right complaint and the
 * wrong cure.
 *
 * **The signature stage is owner-requested (2026-09-06).** The original build took Sign
 * and publish as the act itself, because an order is signed by the bench already logged
 * in and the 1.0 reference asked nothing about how. The owner now wants the same choice
 * the forms and bail-bond queues ask, reached from that same button — so the footer still
 * says Sign and publish, and the stage it opens is where the signature is chosen.
 *
 * A signed order opens here too, read-only. It is the only way to see what was signed
 * without leaving the screen, and offering it costs nothing but the button.
 *
 * **Submit signs nothing.** It marks the row signed in the demo queue and closes — see
 * `lib/employee/sign-orders.ts`. Nothing is written, published, sent or filed, and no
 * e-sign provider is called.
