 * enough to seat its last row, which is the reader's *content above moves up*. Taller
 * than the box, or hanging past the top: align its head, since no amount of scrolling
 * will show all of it and the head is the part that names it.

 * shorter, quieter rail, and the rail was still the wrong object (owner, 2026-09-15: make
 * the bar itself about 16px).
 *
 * **A 16px bar is not reachable through the platform scrollbar, and saying so is part of
 * the decision.** A thumb's *length* is not a CSS property: the browser sizes it as the
 * ratio of the visible box to the scrolled content, so the only ways to shorten it are to
 * shrink the box or lengthen the content, and neither is a design decision anyone would
 * make about a catalogue. A fixed 16px mark would mean drawing a scroll indicator of our
 * own — new UI, and a DS's job rather than a screen's. So the bar goes instead of being
 * miniaturised, which is the same end the ask was reaching for.
 *
 * This is the DS's own intent: `combobox`, `command` and `sidebar` all apply a
 * `no-scrollbar` class — which is defined nowhere in the DS or here, so those three draw
 * the platform bar in spite of it. The properties are held in this constant rather than
 * as a local utility of that name: the missing utility is the DS's to add, and a local
 * copy under the same name would be a second kit answering to no one.
 *
 * Nothing becomes unreachable. The region's content is rows and controls — suggestion
 * tiles, the search field, the group triggers — so a keyboard user moves through it by
 * Tab and the browser scrolls each one into view; wheel, trackpad and touch are
 * untouched; and the content is visibly cut off at the boundary, which is the affordance
 * a rail was adding little to.

      {/* The split the owner drew. Left: what the court did at this sitting and what it
          passed, one section at a time. Right: the order those entries make, on paper.

          **Thirds, and the page takes two of them** (owner, 2026-09-15). It was half and
          half for part of a day, to give an open column room for a roll four checkboxes
          across; the page won instead, because it is the artefact this screen exists to
          produce and the thing a typist reads back. The roll asks for no such width in
          this shape — one section is open at a time, and its two rolls are single columns
          of 40px rows. Below two columns the order of the DOM stands and the page sits
          under the panel.

          The column between the white header and footer is the scoped work canvas:
          `bg-muted` in light so the panels read against the same tone as the rail; dark
          stays `bg-background` because muted sits *above* card there (FilingMain). */}
      <div className="grid min-w-0 flex-1 gap-8 bg-muted p-6 md:p-8 lg:grid-cols-3 dark:bg-background">
        {/* Surfaces on the canvas, not one container holding two columns (owner,
            2026-09-14) — and since 2026-09-16 the left column is two of them rather than
            one. Every one is white and lifted, so the beige canvas is the ground and each
            reads as a thing lying on it — which is what the reference screen does and
            what a shared card was flattening into one object with an internal seam.

            `self-start` on the column and on the page: each surface is as tall as its own
            contents, and the two section cards stack from the top rather than dividing
            the column's height between them. The page held the canvas height while it
            carried a signature at its foot, which gave the sheet somewhere to end;
            without one it was just a long empty margin.

            The columns stay 1/3 and 2/3, as they were before the container was removed.
            Narrowing the panel *and* unwrapping it in one step moved both surfaces at
            once, and the layout stopped being recognisable (owner, 2026-09-14). Only one
            of those was asked for. */}
        {/* **One card per section, one open at a time, and the closed one says where it
            got to** — the sections as they were designed, restored on the owner's
            instruction (2026-09-15) after a day spent as one open column, and split into
            a card each on 2026-09-16. That is the whole reason this beat an icon rail: a
            rail can show you marks but not one fact, so the panel had nothing in it and
            the way on ended up below the fold. A row that reads "Orders — None yet" is
            the state and the way back to it in the same line.

            **The split is the surround, not the behaviour** (owner, 2026-09-16).
            Applications and Orders were two rows of one card, ruled apart by a hairline;
            they are now two surfaces on the canvas. Nothing about the interaction moved:
            `section` still holds at most one id, so opening one closes the other, and
            answering the last application still folds Applications shut and opens the
            order catalogue — see `decide`. What changes is that the fold is now a card
            closing to its own 56px row rather than half a panel collapsing inside a box
            that stays the same size either way.

            `Collapsible` and not `Accordion`: the DS `Accordion` renders its header as
            a fixed `h3`, which would skip a level under this page's `h1` (D16 on this
            screen made the same call for the same reason).

            Not D16's mechanism, which was reversed. That folded the roll *for you* once
            every appearance was marked, and bought nothing on arrival because the
            screen opens unmarked. This is the navigation itself: it moves when you
            move, never on its own.

            **The rows are the only way through, and they are enough.** A "Next" inside
            each open section was a second control doing what the row below it already
            did, on a column where both rows are always in view. Nothing gates the move
            either way: an application can stand over, a roll can go unmarked, a date can
            be left unset, and the page prints the gap rather than a card refusing to move
            on.

            `gap-0 p-2` on each card: the card's own 8px is what gives the trigger its
            air, so a closed section is a 56px list row on its own surface — the metric
            the rows already had when a hairline separated them. `gap-0` because the
            `Collapsible` is the card's only child and `Card`'s 24px default gap would
            otherwise open under a closed row as empty white. */}
        {/* **The column is pinned and fits the window** (owner, 2026-09-16: *I have to
            scroll the page instead of being able to scroll completely down within that
            orders container itself*).

            The catalogue has had its own scroll since 2026-09-15, but the box holding it
            was `50svh` measured from nowhere — so once the chrome bar, the cause header,
            the canvas padding, two section rows and the search field were counted, the
            bottom of that box sat below the fold. Scrolling it to its end still left
            *Directives* off screen, and the only way to it was the page: an inner scroll
            that runs out before its own content does, inside an outer one that owns the
            rest.

            `lg:h-(--order-panel-height)` is the correction — the window less the two
            bands that overlay it, so the column ends where the footer begins — and
            `lg:sticky` keeps it there while the sheet beside it is read down.

            **A height, not a `max-height`.** It was the latter for one build and the
            catalogue stopped scrolling: a `max-height`-clamped box is still an *auto*
            height box, and every flex child below it was asking for a share of a height
            that had not been decided. A definite height at the top of the chain is what
            lets `flex-1` mean the same thing at each of the six boxes beneath it. The
            cost is a card with slack in it when an open section is shorter than the
            column, which the catalogue almost never is — and nothing else on the canvas
            is stretched, since the column carries no fill of its own and the closed card
            beside it keeps its own 56px.

            `self-start` was already here and is what makes the pin possible: a stretched
            grid item has no slack to stick in. `lg:overflow-y-auto` is a net for the
            other section — the catalogue fills the clamp exactly, so this engages only if
            a long list of applications overruns the column, and a scroll there beats a
            row hidden under the footer.

            Below `lg` the columns are stacked and nothing is pinned or clamped: the page
            scroll is the right one on a phone, and the `50svh` cap still applies there.

            **Not pinned or clamped at any width once the case file is open.** The
            column now also carries the sheet (below), and the fixed height was sized
            for two section cards — the sheet's own well and passage want the page's
            scroll, not a second scroller nested inside this one. The catalogue's own
            `max-h-(--order-panel-height)` belt (`OrderItems`) is a plain CSS value, not
            dependent on this column's height, so it keeps the catalogue scrolling in
            place either way. */}

                            muted glyphs left the four rows reading as one block of text.

                            `brand-muted` / `brand-muted-foreground`, never `primary`:
                            the sanctioned tint pair, contrast vetted in the DS and
                            inverting properly in dark (a deep teal plate under a bright
                            glyph). A solid `bg-primary` would have put four full-strength
                            brand blocks against the one primary action on the screen.

                            `size-8 rounded-lg` is the DS's own icon-tile metric
                            (`EmptyMedia variant="icon"`) and the same square the home
                            screen's list rows wear, so this is the app's existing tile at
                            the size a 40px row can carry — not a new one. `aria-hidden`
                            sits on the tile: the plate and the glyph are both decoration,

 * What this sitting has already answered.
 *
 * **Rows, not cards** (owner, 2026-09-15: the answered cards "look really weird"). They
 * were the pending card with its decisions taken out — a filled sunken box, 106px tall,
 * holding a status word on its own line, a title, a number, and one text button floating
 * where three controls used to be. A card is the right object for a decision the bench
 * has to make, and the wrong one for a decision it has already made: there is nothing to
 * act on here, so what the list owes the reader is *what was answered and how*, as
 * briefly as that can be said.
 *
 * So: the decision as a `Badge` in the DS's own status pair — `success` for allowed,
 * `destructive` for dismissed, muted fill against muted-foreground, never the ink alone —
 * then the application and its serial, then the way in. Hairline rules between rows
 * rather than four boxes on the panel's own white, which is the separation the section
 * rows above already use. The word is in the badge, so the status is never colour alone
 * (ACCESSIBILITY §3).
 *
 * `View` keeps `link`, the DS's text button, and the row centres it rather than aligning
 * it to the top (owner, 2026-09-15). At the top it sat level with the decision pill,
 * which read as a control *on* the badge — and the badge is a state, not something to
 * act on. Centred, it lands between the application and its serial: level with the pair
 * it opens, and it stays there whether the name takes one line or three, which an
 * alignment to any single line does not.

              `self-start` on the badge because a `Badge` is an inline-flex span, and a
              flex column stretches its children — without it the pill would run the full
              width of the row as a bar.

              Two gaps, not one: 6px under the decision, 2px between the application and
              its serial. The name and the number are one fact about one application; the
              decision is a different fact about it, so the spacing groups them that

/**
 * What the court passed today, chosen from the court's own catalogue.
 *
 * **Choosing the order is what writes it.** A typist is not composing a direction from
 * nothing; they are setting down one the court has already made, from the court's
 * standing form. So the catalogue is the instrument — the twenty-five templates of
 * `order-templates.ts`.
 *
 * Built to the owner's reference screen, in three parts:
 *
 * 1. **A search field over the categories**, which replaces the `Combobox` an earlier
 *    revision used. The trade is deliberate: a combobox is faster for a typist who knows
 *    the word and shows *nothing* to one who does not, because its list only exists while
 *    the menu is open. Standing rows say how much catalogue there is before anyone types.
 * 2. **Likely at this hearing** — ranked, and off the sitting rather than off the purpose
 *    alone (`order-suggestions.ts`, 2026-09-14). The source's purpose table is still the
 *    baseline, so an evidence listing still offers witness batta and a witness summons;
 *    what is new is that the applications standing in the matter, an absence the bench has
 *    just marked, and the orders already in this draft can each put something above them
 *    and say why. **The ordinary row stays uncaptioned and keeps its workflow line** — the
 *    heading already says why it is there, and a second sentence saying "usual at this
 *    hearing" under a list headed "Likely at this hearing" is a line of type carrying no
 *    information. A row a signal moved gets the signal instead: "Follows CMP/312/2026,
 *    allowed at this hearing". One per line rather than the reference's 2-up: its rail is
 *    wider than this column, and "Moving case out of long pending register" does not
 *    survive a 145px tile. It answers to no query — the sitting is what ranks it, not a
 *    word — so it stays put under the field while the categories below it filter.
 * 3. **Every order in its category, including the ones this matter cannot take**, each
 *    with the reason under it. The source gates several types on the state of the case,
 *    and a silently shorter list is the worse failure on a screen where the missing order
 *    is the one that mattered.
 *
 * **One unified, categorised list (owner, 2026-09-25), not two tabs.** An earlier build
 * split "system orders" (the twenty-five worded by the catalogue) from "custom orders"
 * (Judgement, which the source gives no words for, plus `others` — the one order that is
 * not the court's at all). That split is gone: Judgement now sits in its own **Judgment**
 * category like any other row, captioned "No template — opens empty" instead of the
 * workflow line, and "Something else" stands as its own row under the categories rather
 * than in a second tab.
 *
 * **The categories are the owner's own grouping (2026-09-25)** — the catalogue's
 * `Category` column, not the four provisional headings (`Process orders` / `Accept
 * Reject` / `Case progression` / `Directives`) an earlier build used as a placeholder.
 * See `ORDER_GROUPS` in `order-templates.ts` for why **Accept / Reject** still exists
 * outside that column: it is where this screen keeps the handful of types the source
 * marks *not in dropdown*, disabled rather than hidden, on the same reasoning as point 3
 * above — a type that used to be visible going silent is a worse failure than a greyed
 * row nobody can click.

    /* **The catalogue scrolls, the panel does not** (owner, 2026-09-15). This region is
       the only thing in the panel with unbounded height — twenty-seven orders in nine
       groups, plus the shortcuts above them — so it was what pushed the panel past the
       viewport and made reading down the catalogue drag the whole surface, section rows
       and all, up off the screen. Capped and scrolled in place, the panel stays as tall
       as the screen can hold and the catalogue moves within it, which is what the reader
       is actually moving through.

       **The search field stands outside the box** (owner, 2026-09-16), which is why it is
       the one part of this region that cannot scroll away: it is a sibling above the
       scroller rather than its first child. A query is the instrument for a list this
       long, and an instrument that leaves the screen the moment you look down the list
       it filters has to be chased back before it can be corrected. Pinned by position
       rather than `sticky`: nothing then has to be layered over the fades, and the field
       needs no fill of its own to stop the rows travelling under it.

       **And the suggestions moved under it** (owner, 2026-09-16). *Likely at this
       hearing* was the first thing in the panel and the search was below it, which put a
       three-row shortcut list between the reader and the only control that reaches the
       other twenty-four. The shortcuts are still first in the scroller, so they are what
       a typist meets on arrival — they just no longer sit above the field.

       **The cap is the height that is left, not a fraction of the window** (owner,
       2026-09-16). `max-h-[50svh]` was half the viewport measured from nowhere: with the
       chrome bar, the cause header, the canvas padding, two section rows and the search
       field above it, the box itself ran past the fold — so the list could be scrolled to
       its end with its last group still off screen, reachable only by scrolling the page.
       From `lg` up the box is a flex child of a column that is pinned and clamped to the
       window, which states the same rule against the height that actually remains.

       **Flex, never a percentage** (2026-09-16). This was `h-full` for one build and the
       region stopped scrolling altogether: a percentage height resolves against the
       parent's, the parent's came from a `max-height` clamp and so was never decided, and
       `height: 100%` against an undecided height computes to `auto` — the box grew to its
       own content and had nothing left to scroll. `flex-1` with `min-h-0` at every box
       between here and the column asks for the leftover in the one language that has a
       definite answer, and the column now states a height rather than a ceiling.

       The `max-h-(--order-panel-height)` beside it is a belt, not the mechanism: it is
       looser than the flex result — the field and the shortcuts sit above this box inside
       the same card — so it never binds while the fill works, and it keeps this region
       scrollable rather than endless if it ever stops working.

       The `svh` cap stays for the stacked layout below `lg`, where the page scroll is the
       right one — and `svh` rather than `vh` because on a phone `vh` is the viewport with
       the browser's chrome *hidden*, so a `vh` box is taller than anything anyone can see
       until they scroll (RESPONSIVE.md). `overscroll-contain` stops the page taking over
       when the list reaches its end — a scroll that jumps to the document the moment a
       list bottoms out is the same fault as the panel moving in the first place.

       `NO_SCROLLBAR` takes the bar away; with no thumb over the words, the `pe-1` that
       kept them apart goes with it. What says the region scrolls instead is the fade at
       whichever edge it continues past — see `useScrollEdges`. The fades are laid over
       the box rather than inside it, so they stay at its edges while the content moves
       under them, and they run from `card` to `card/0` because the panel they sit on is
       `card`: a fade has to end in the colour behind it or it reads as a band of its own.
       `card/0` rather than `transparent` — CSS interpolates a gradient towards
       `transparent` through transparent *black*, which greys the middle of a fade on a
       light panel; the same colour at zero alpha fades in the one hue it should.

       `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events-none`: it is a shadow of the content, not content
       of its own, and a scroll region you cannot click through is worse than one with no
       fade. */

                    to guess which sentences were once this template's. The guess is what

                    exactly what it wrote, and the same mark answers the question in the
                    other direction — delete the passage in the page beside this and the
                    row goes with it, because the row is a record of a passage that no
                    longer exists (owner, 2026-09-16).

                    The control is the app's own row-removal recipe, as the task screens'
                    document slots wear it (`components/tasks/act/shared.tsx`): a ghost
                    trash at `icon-xs`, whose `size-8` is grown by `after:-inset-1` to the
                    40×40 the Laws require of an icon-sized target (ACCESSIBILITY §8).

/**
 * The order, on paper, as the thing the typist is actually making.

 * This replaces a panel of three labelled boxes — an attendance box, an item box and a

 * reference puts the document itself in this column and it is right to: the typist is
 * setting down a page a court will read, and a page is the only honest preview of a
 * page. The furniture around the writing is the court's own — the title, attendance,
 * the next posting, the signature — and none of it is typed, because every one of those
 * facts is already known to the listing.
 *
 * **No cause block.** The page opened on a printed heading held back to 60% — the court,
 * the case number, the matter, the date, a roll of the parties with their counsel, and
 * the offence. It came out (owner, 2026-09-15). All of it is already on screen: the
 * strip above this column names the case and the matter, and the column beside it
 * carries the item and the purpose. The copy that leaves this court is not short of a
 * cause title either — the signing queue renders the same document with its own heading,
 * from the same `court`, `matter` and `dated` fields. Repeating it here spent a third of
 * the sheet before the first line of what the court actually passed.
 *
 * `paper` is the DS family for exactly this and for nothing else: a fixed facsimile that
 * does not invert in dark, because a printed page does not change colour with the
 * product palette. It is the same treatment the signing queue uses on the same artefact,
 * so what the bench reads back here is what it will see when it comes to sign.
 *
 * **One writable region, ruled off at the top, and always there.** Below attendance
 * and the next posting sits the one part of the page that is composed rather than known:
 * a single editor holding the whole of what the court passed. It was a band carrying one
 * bordered well per template, which grew the page a box at a time and made a document
 * read as a stack of forms (owner, 2026-09-15) — so the wells collapsed into one editor.
 * The top rule stayed: it is the reference's own, and it says where the court's standing
 * furniture stops and the typist's work begins. The matching rule below did not: with
 * nothing under the writing, it was a leftover divider (owner, 2026-09-15).

 *    one column for the offices, one for their answers — sized `w-fit`, so the answers
 *    line up directly after the longest office and the pair reads as a row of a table.
 *    That is what an attendance roll is, and it is why the roll needed no second change
 *    when the block moved into half the sheet's width: a table that hugs its content fits
 *    whatever column it is given.
 * 2. Four full-height wells stacked down the page were the loudest objects on a sheet
 *    whose whole point is the writing. `size="compact"` is the DS's answer for exactly
 *    this — a 32px well that keeps its 40px hit target — so the wells stop being slabs
 *    without any of them becoming a smaller target than the Laws allow.
 * 3. Nothing ended it, so the controls read as furniture rather than as work with an
 *    end. The last answer closes the block now: four offices answered is the whole of
 *    the question, and the printed lines are what the sheet shows from then on.
 *
 * `SegmentedControl`, not the panel's two checkbox rolls: one question per person with
 * one answer, so *Present | Absent* beside the office is the shortest true form of it,
 * and a person cannot be ticked into both rolls at once. It carries state as weight
 * rather than as brand colour, which is what keeps four of them quiet on paper.

          than by anything on the page.

          `minmax(0,1fr)` for the offices and `auto` for the answers: the roll now spans
          the block, the answers line up on its right edge, and the slack between the two
          is on the side where nothing is reading. The narrow-screen behaviour the `w-fit`
          note was protecting is *better* here, not worse — the slack is explicitly the
          office column's, so a long or translated role label takes the squeeze by
          wrapping, and `auto` means the answers can never be compressed or pushed off the

/**
 * The order, as one box.
 *
 * **One editor, not one per template** (owner, 2026-09-15). The page grew a second
 * bordered well every time an order was pulled from the catalogue, which is not how a
 * sheet of paper behaves and made the paper read as a form stack rather than a document.
 * The templates are now where words *come from*: pressing one appends its direction to
 * the end of this box and the typist shapes the result — joining two into a sentence,
 * splitting one, numbering them with the editor's own list marks, deleting what the
 * court did not pass.
 *
 * **It is here whether or not anything has been added**, which is the other half of the
 * owner's instruction. A bench that wants to write the order straight out, without
 * touching the catalogue at all, can: the box does not have to be summoned into being
 * first, and there is no empty-state sentence standing where the writing goes.
 *
 * `RichTextField` rather than a plain `Textarea`: an order carries emphasis and numbered
 * directions, the editor already exists for exactly this (`rich-text-field.tsx`), and the
 * catalogue's own text arrives as markup. `labelId` is the page's `ORDER` heading — a
 * contentEditable region cannot be labelled by a `<label>`, and the sheet already names
 * this: a second eyebrow over the box would say "Order" twice.
 *
 * **`revision` is load-bearing.** The editor keeps the markup it opened on and never
 * rewrites its own DOM while it is mounted — that is what stops it eating the caret
 * mid-word — so an append from the panel would otherwise land in the draft and never
 * appear on the page. Keying it on how many templates have been pulled in remounts it on
 * exactly those events and on no others: typing does not change the count, so the caret
 * is safe, and what the typist has already written is preserved because it is in `value`
 * by then.

           information, which is not true").

           The passage has always been a list of blocks — the roll, the disposals, each
           direction, the posting — and the plain side already joins them on a blank line
           (`plainTextOfRichText`). Only the box collapsed them: a `<p>` carries no margin
           here, so a direction written in by the catalogue landed flush under the
           typist's own sentence and the two read as one paragraph.

           **Drawn, so it cannot be consumed.** The alternative was to insert empty
           paragraphs between the blocks, and it fails on exactly the flow that reported
           this: the typist writes *into* the blank line — that is what it invites — and
           the gap it was holding is gone by the time the next section arrives. A rule
           about the blocks holds however they are edited, and it spaces every seam,
           including the two directions the catalogue adds back to back.

           24px, which is the line this box would have added — the same gap the owner's
           own two presses of Enter produced. Scoped to the direct children of the

/**
 * Where the matter is posted to, settled on the sheet.
 *
 * **The second half of the same exploration** (owner, 2026-09-15): the two lines this
 * block printed — *Purpose of next hearing* and *Date of next hearing* — are the labels
 * of the controls that set them, and once both are answered they are those lines again.
 *
 * **The labels sit above their controls, and the controls fill the column.** They were
 * a label beside a `w-48` control while this block had the sheet's whole width; in half
 * of it, a long label and a fixed control wrapped into an accidental stack — the same
 * layout, arrived at by running out of room, which is how a field ends up with its
 * control in a different place on every row. Stated instead: two full-width fields, and
 * the pair reads down the column rather than across it.
 *
 * **The exception keeps its own line and its own polarity.** *List it again* is the
 * ordinary end of a §138 listing and the reference's "Skip scheduling next hearing"
 * asked it backwards; the panel's version fixed that and this keeps the fix. It sits
 * above the two rows because unticking it takes them away — a control that removes what
 * is under it does not belong beneath them.
 *
 * **The calendar is owned here rather than taken from `DatePicker`** (owner, 2026-09-15:
 * the date "dropdown is not working properly"; open it upward so the whole month is
 * visible). `DatePicker` renders its own `Popover` and hardcodes `align="start"` with no
 * side, no collision padding and no way to close the surface when a day is chosen — a
 * screen using it cannot reach any of that, in props or in CSS, which is `ds-requests`
 * 19 and the same reason the bulk-reschedule filter owns its own popover. Owning it buys
 * three things this block needs:
 *
 * - `side="top"`. This block is the last thing on a long sheet, so a calendar opening
 *   downward opens into the sticky footer and the viewport edge. Above the trigger it has
 *   the whole page to sit in. `collisionPadding` keeps it off the edge if it does flip,
 *   and the available-width ceiling keeps it from hanging off a narrow screen
 *   (RESPONSIVE.md 9).
 * - **It closes when a day is chosen.** The primitive leaves the surface standing over
 *   the sheet after the answer has been given, which is most of what "not working
 *   properly" was: the date *was* set, underneath a calendar still covering the page.
 * - The trigger is named by the printed label beside it rather than by a repeated one.
