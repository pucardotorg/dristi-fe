/**
 * A matter from the day's list, read over the list it came from.
 *
 * **One thing opens it: the cause title, and the row that delegates to it.** Reading a
 * matter is one act and calling it is another, and they are now cleanly one control
 * each. The overlay used to be the destination for both — Start hearing marked the
 * listing ongoing and opened this on its way — which made calling the list a run of
 * presses each answered by a sheet to dismiss. Calling no longer opens anything
 * (owner, 2026-09-12); it changes the row it was pressed on and leaves the day where it
 * was.
 *
 * So opening this changes nothing about the matter. Whatever the chip in the header
 * reads is the row's own status, arrived at before this was opened.
 *
 * What it shows is the case overview's own sections, not a second reading of them
 * (`HearingOverviewSections`). The route survives underneath for the one job an overlay
 * cannot do — a link that has to outlive the page, in a bookmark or a typed URL — but no
 * control on the list hands one out any more.
 *
 * **It reads, and it calls — nothing else.** The sitting's other outcomes stay on the
 * row: Pass over is not a second session verb (`HearingPassOverMenu`) and the order
 * composer is a trip of its own. What the footer carries is the one control that moves
 * *this* matter through the day, and it is the same control the row carries, in the same
 * four states (`HearingSessionButton`) — one vocabulary, two places to reach it, rather
 * than an overlay that invents a second way to say Start. It reads whatever the matter's
 * next move is at the moment it was opened: Start hearing on a listing still to be
 * called, End hearing on one under way, and spent on one already heard.
 *
 * Pressing it resolves in place (ui-craft §7): the chip and the footer change where they
 * stand, nothing remounts, and the reader is not thrown back to the list to find out
 * what happened. The row underneath has already changed too — the mark lives outside
 * this component (`lib/employee/hearing-session.ts`), which is what lets the two agree.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a court record.** The same bargain the cause list already makes
 * (`lib/employee/hearings.ts`): starting a hearing is a screen mark, and View case is
 * not connected to anything.

       only ever reads a listing and acts on it — and a single-stage flow costs the frame
       nothing while still getting its rise, its chrome and its landing place.

       `sm:max-w-4xl` is what lets the sections keep their two-column pairing inside the
       sheet instead of stacking into a tall scroll. Height stays a cap rather than a
       measure — unlike the review overlays, which hold a document preview and want the
       full 85dvh whatever is in it. A first listing here is three short sections, and a
       sheet pinned to 85dvh for them would be mostly empty. So no `floor` either.

       **Two things this sheet used to do its own way, normalised.** Its stage was
       `bg-surface-sunken` where every other court-side stage is `bg-muted`, and its header
       carried no rule, separating itself from the stage by fill alone. Both were reasoned,
       and both were this one sheet reading differently from its fourteen siblings — which
       is the thing the owner asked to end. `bg-muted` is also what `ui-craft` §1.0 names as
       the product canvas; `surface-sunken` is the DS's *nested well inside a panel*. */
