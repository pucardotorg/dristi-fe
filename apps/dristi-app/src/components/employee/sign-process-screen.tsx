/**
 * Sign process — every summons, notice, warrant and proclamation this court has issued,
 * from the cover it waits on to the word its channel sends back.
 *
 * **Three tabs, by who the process is waiting on** (owner, 2026-10-06; see
 * `lib/employee/sign-process.ts`): RPAD collection waits on the advocate, Issuance on
 * the court, Service on the channel. Inside a tab the statuses are **pills** — the
 * pending-tasks row, one at a time, with All to see the tab whole and banded by status.
 * The tab is the job and the pill narrows it, so the bench never changes tab to finish
 * one.
 *
 * **Acts come from the selection, not from the pill.** A Issuance selection can hold
 * rows to sign, covers to post and failed sends at once; each gets its own button over its
 * own count, the first of them the one strong action (Ration teal). Under one pill that
 * is simply that pill's act.
 *
 * **Paper in hand is matched one number at a time.** Three statuses are the clerk holding
 * a stack — covers arriving, covers going to the post office, acknowledgements coming
 * back — and on each the search box takes a case number and Enter puts that envelope on
 * the pile, shown in a tray above the list. Same gesture, same tray, three moments.
 *
 * Everything below the tab strip is the court-side furniture the rest of the rail uses:
 * one lifted panel holding the controls, the list and the footer. **Selection does not
 * survive a change of tab or pill** — rows ticked to sign mean nothing under Service.
 *
 * **Nothing is signed, sent, posted or recorded.** Every act moves a row in the demo line.
