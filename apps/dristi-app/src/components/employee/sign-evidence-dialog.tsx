/**
 * One marking, read and then signed — the single-document path off the evidence queue.
 *
 * Two stages, and both are the reference's: the particulars of the marking with the day's
 * business under them, and — behind Edit details — the form that changes what the marking
 * says. The reference draws the second as a modal over the first; here it is a stage of
 * the same overlay, because two stacked dialogs put two focus traps on one decision and
 * the DS ships no nested-dialog pattern (ACCESSIBILITY §5). Nothing else about it changes:
 * the same four fields, the same locked prefix, the same Cancel and Proceed.
 *
 * It is `StagedOverlay` that holds them together. Each stage used to draw its own header
 * and its own footer, so answering Edit details replaced the whole window at once — which
 * is the abruptness the frame exists to end. Now the chrome renders once and stays put,
 * and the only thing that moves is the stage between it: forward to the form, back from
 * it.
 *
 * **There is no document here, and that is not an omission.** What waits for signature is
 * the court's endorsement of a document already on the case's own register — the
 * particulars *are* the record being signed. The two signing queues beside this one open a
 * facsimile because there the court wrote the paper; here it did not, and the reference
 * shows none either.
 *
 * **The only act is e-sign.** The forms queue asks how a party will sign — e-sign, or
 * upload the paper they signed — because a form is sworn by somebody who may be standing
 * in the court office. An exhibit is endorsed by the bench that is already logged in, and
 * the reference offers one button.
 *
 * **E-sign signs nothing.** It drops the row from the demo queue and closes — see
 * `lib/employee/sign-evidence.ts`. No signature is applied, no exhibit is endorsed,
 * nothing is written to the A-Diary and no e-sign provider is called.

/**
 * What the marking says — the stage the act opens on.

 * The four particulars sit in a card on the stage: `DescriptionList` inside `Card` is the
 * DS's own recipe for one record's key-value fields (Laws, "Grouped content gets a
 * border"), and it is lifted rather than sunken because a sunken fill on the tinted stage
 * is the stage's own tone and the panel would have no edge at all.
 *
 * The day's business is not one of the particulars: it is the one thing on this overlay
 * the bench writes, so it is a real field in its own panel rather than a fifth row of
 * read-only text.
 *
 * A `Textarea` where the reference draws a single-line input: the day's business runs to
 * two lines (`lib/cases/orders.ts`), and a court that deploys in Malayalam or Tamil sets
 * longer strings in taller glyphs. A one-line field scrolls the sentence out of sight
 * instead of wrapping it (ACCESSIBILITY §10, §13).
 *
 * Emptying that field is the one thing here that stops the signature. The reference
 * validates nothing, but the line is what the day's record carries about this exhibit —
 * signing a blank one endorses an exhibit the register cannot describe. The court's draft
 * is always one step away, so the dead end is never a trap.

/**
 * What the marking says, changed — the reference's Mark as evidence form, as the second

 *
 * The reference draws it as a modal over the first. Here it is a stage: two stacked
 * dialogs put two focus traps on one decision and the DS ships no nested-dialog pattern
 * (ACCESSIBILITY §5), and the header and footer stay exactly where they were while only
 * the form between them travels. Nothing else about it changes — the same four fields,
 * the same locked prefix, the same Cancel and Proceed.
 *
 * Two of its four fields cannot be changed here: the document's own title and who filed
 * it are facts about the filing, not about the court's marking of it. They stay in the
 * form because they say what is being marked, and they are `readOnly` rather than the
 * reference's `disabled` — a disabled control is out of the tab order and unreachable by
 * a voice user naming its label, and there is nothing to disable here, only nothing to
 * type (ACCESSIBILITY §4, §9).
 *
 * The exhibit's series letter is the third thing that cannot be typed, and the reference
 * locks it as a dropdown with one option. Here it is an `InputGroupAddon variant="field"` —
 * the DS's own cell for a value that qualifies what the user types, which is exactly what
 * a series letter does. A select that cannot be opened is a control that keyboard and
 * voice users can reach and not operate; the addon is not a control at all, and the field
 * description says what decides the letter.
 *
 * Proceed is in the frame's footer, so the form carries an `id` and the button points at
 * it — the same wiring the footer used when it was drawn inside this step.
