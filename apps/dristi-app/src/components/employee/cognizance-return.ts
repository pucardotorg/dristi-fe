/**
 * Which tab the queue should open on when a complaint sends the magistrate back to it.
 *
 * The queue is two tabs and a complaint is one page, so the way back has to say which
 * half of the register it is returning to. Without this, a bench working through the
 * late complaints lands on the timely ones after every decision — and since *Next
 * complaint* stays on the tab (`nextCognizanceCase`), Back would be the one control in
 * the loop that moved them.
 *
 * It cannot be read off the URL: `/employee/cognizance` is both tabs, and the complaint
 * it came from is gone by the time the queue mounts. So the control that navigates says
 * where it is going, and the screen that mounts takes it — `useArrival`'s bargain, for
 * the same three reasons. A module variable rather than storage: it is one hop, it must
 * not survive a reload (a refreshed queue has not come back from anywhere), and nothing
 * else should be able to read it.
