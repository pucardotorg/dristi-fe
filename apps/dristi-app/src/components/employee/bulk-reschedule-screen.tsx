/**
 * What a click on the range calendar should mean — which is not what the calendar means
 * by it.
 *
 * `react-day-picker`'s range mode treats the first day as fixed and every later click as
 * dragging the far end: from 13–25, clicking the 22nd gives 13–22, and clicking the 23rd
 * gives 13–23. There is no click that starts somewhere else. The only way back to a fresh
 * span is to land exactly on the start date, which collapses it — a move nobody finds,
 * and the reason the control read as having no way to clear and pick again (owner,
 * 2026-09-13, measured on the render before this).
 *
 * So the rule every date-range control the bench has used elsewhere follows: **a finished
 * span is finished.** The next click begins a new one on the day clicked, and the click
 * after that closes it. Widening 13–19 to 13–22 costs one extra click; being unable to
 * ask for 20–25 at all cost the whole control.
 *
 * The day clicked is not handed over, so it is read back out of what changed — the
 * calendar has already moved exactly one end, or cleared the span because the click
 * landed on its start.
 *
 * **Whether an end is being held is told, not inferred.** It used to be read off the
 * value as `from !== to`, which is true of a span half-drawn and false of a span of one
 * day — two different things wearing one shape. Ask for a single day (click it twice),
 * reopen, and click the 5th meaning only the 5th: the click was taken as the *far end*
 * of a span that was already finished, and the board got `5 Sept – 14 Sept` — ten days,
 * nine of them behind the court, on the screen that moves twenty-two matters at once.
 * The caller knows which click this is because it watched the previous one, so it says.

/**
 * Bulk reschedule — moving a span of this court's board to another date in one act.
 *
 * The job is the day the bench does not sit: leave, transfer, a holiday declared late.
 * The court pulls up everything listed across a range of days and lists it again
 * somewhere else, rather than opening twenty case files.
 *
 * Composed exactly as today's cause list is (`HearingsScreen`) — the two screens are
 * siblings in the same rail group and the bench should not have to learn a second layout.
 * The page title stands on the page, and **one** lifted panel holds the filters and the
 * table together (ui-craft §4: no box inside a box). What this screen adds is a sticky
 * action bar, because the act is committed once for a list long enough to scroll away
 * from its own button.
 *
 * **Nothing is picked when the screen opens, and the date is asked for inside the act.**
 * Both are the same correction, made on the render (owner, 2026-09-13). The screen used
 * to open with the whole range checked — twenty-two matters already committed to moving
 * before the bench had said anything — and it carried a second container above the table
 * holding a date picker and an Apply button, which wrote a new date into a column the
 * table then read back. That is two acts, a worksheet between them, and a page that had
 * already answered the question it was asking. Now: the bench picks, the footer counts
 * what was picked, and the one button opens an overlay that asks for the date and
 * commits. One flow, one date, one commitment.
 *
 * **The move is a demo move, and the board shows it.** Confirming writes the new date
 * onto the matters for this session, and the rows stay on the board they were picked out
 * of, now carrying both ends of the change — the day each was listed on, and the day it
 * goes to. That is the whole of the feedback for an act that touches twenty matters at
 * once, so it belongs on the thing that was acted on rather than only in the overlay that
 * closes over it. Nothing further happens: no notification is drawn up for the parties, nobody is
 * told, and a reload puts the board back. The settled stage of the overlay says so, in
 * the place it matters, rather than letting the screen imply the act is finished.

/**
 * Which days to pull in, and what to look for inside them.
 *
 * Laid out the way today's cause list lays out its filters, and labelled the same way:
 * every control carries a visible label, because the reference labels none of them and
 * the accessibility floor treats a placeholder as a hint rather than a label
 * (ACCESSIBILITY §12).
 *
 * **There is no Search button on this row, and the span's confirmation is not one.**
 * The screen had a date picker and an Apply above the table, and they were taken out on
 * 2026-09-13 as "two acts, a worksheet between them"; a reference the owner brought on
 * 2026-09-14 offered named spans (`Last 7 days`) and an **Apply Custom Filter** beside
 * them, and neither came across — the spans were built, put beside the field, moved
 * inside the picker and dropped, because the calendar is the one question this filter
 * asks (owner, across 2026-09-14).
 *
 * What the picker now carries is a different thing in a different place: the **Apply
 * inside the calendar** that closes the span the bench drew (owner, 2026-09-16, and see
 * `RangeField`). A button on this row would be a second stop on the page, standing at
 * rest between the bench and a board it can already see. A button inside the surface is
 * the end of the one act the bench opened, on the surface it opened, and the row it
 * leaves behind is still two fields and nothing else.
 *
 * The teal is spent the same way it was. A page at rest paints one strong fill —
 * Reschedule in the commit bar, the act that moves twenty listings — because the picker's
 * Apply exists only while its overlay is open, which is the reading of the Ration Teal
 * Law this screen's own dialogs already take.

/**
 * The span of days the board is showing — **one control that says it is a range**.
 *
 * It was two fields once: `Listed from` and `Listed until`, each its own single-date
 * picker. They were read on the render as two unrelated date fields rather than as the
 * two ends of one thing — *"it was not apparent that this is a date range selector"*
 * (stakeholder, via the owner, 2026-09-13). Two adjacent controls can only ever be a
 * range by convention; one control whose value is a span says so before it is read.
 *
 * **Composed from `Popover` and `Calendar` rather than taken from `DateRangePicker`,
 * and that is a deliberate step away from the primitive.**
 *
 * It began as the only way to put a row of named spans inside the picker rather than
 * beside it (owner, 2026-09-14). The spans were then dropped — the calendar is the one
 * question this filter asks, and it did not want a second way of answering it — but the
 * composition stays, because what it actually bought was §19 itself.
 *
 * `DateRangePicker` renders its own `Popover` and its own `Calendar`, takes no
 * `children`, spreads its `className` onto the trigger `Button`, and portals its content
 * to `document.body`. So a screen using it cannot reach the calendar inside it, in props
 * or in CSS, and three of the four defects filed against it are unreachable from here —
 * which is the whole of `ds-requests` 19. Owning the popover fixes all three rather than
 * working around them:
 *
 * - **(a)** `showOutsideDays={false}`. Two adjacent months draw each other's edge days,
 *   so September's trailing cells and October's leading cells were the same dates drawn
 *   twice and lit twice — one span painting two ends.
 * - **(c)** the calendar dismisses on Apply. The primitive leaves it standing over the
 *   page after the one decision it exists for, and owning the surface is what lets the
 *   bench close it deliberately instead.
 * - **(e)** the `×` no longer costs the calendar. It sits outside the portalled content,
 *   so Radix's dismissable layer read the press as an outside click and closed the
 *   popover the bench was still using; with `open` held here, clearing clears and nothing
 *   else moves.
 *
 * **A one-day span is held as `to: undefined`.** That is what draws a single date rather
 * than the same day written twice with a dash between it, and it is the state the
 * calendar wants when the next click is going to set the other end. The board still reads
 * it as `from = to`: a court sitting on one day is a range of one, not an unfinished
 * question. What a click does to a span already finished is decided in
 * `nextRangeFromPick`, not by the calendar.
 *
 * **The span is drawn here and applied on a press.** The calendar holds a draft; the
 * board is not narrowed until *Apply*, and leaving the surface any other way — Escape,
 * a click on the page, the trigger again — abandons what was drawn and leaves the board
 * on what it was showing. A range takes two clicks, so a span applied as it is drawn
 * spends its first click narrowing the board to a single day nobody asked for, and its
 * second widening it back; the bench watched twenty-two rows vanish and return between
 * two clicks of one gesture, and never saw the finished span at all, because closing it
 * dismissed the calendar in the same motion (owner, 2026-09-16). Now the span is drawn,
 * shown in the surface's own footer in the words the rows use, and applied when the bench
 * says so.
 *
 * *Apply* is the only button here. A Cancel would be a second way to do what Escape, the
 * trigger and the rest of the page already do, on a surface whose draft costs nothing to
 * abandon. It carries no glyph — the label is the whole of it.
 *
 * It is disabled while there is no day on the calendar, and enabled from the first click
 * onwards — **including when the span drawn is the one already applied.** Gating on
 * *different from the board* was the other candidate and is what a Search button would
 * do, but this button is also the way out of the surface, and the dead end it makes is
 * easy to walk into: reopen on 14–20, click 14, click 20, and the press the footer is
 * asking for is refused for re-drawing what was wanted. Re-applying an identical span
 * costs a render of the same rows, so the honest gate is the one about the calendar
 * being empty.
 *
 * **The span is given back from the `×` on the field**, the way the search box beside it
 * gives its text back, and it appears only once there is a span to clear (owner,
 * 2026-09-13). `Clear filters` drops the search and the span together and is the empty
 * state's business; a field's own clear takes only what the field holds.
 *
 * The width is the caller's, and the id prefixes the label element it owns.

              A two-month calendar has a floor it cannot shrink past: the months stack
              into one column below `md`, which is enough at a phone's default text size,
              and is not once the text grows. Measured at 200% on a 375px viewport, the
              calendar alone wants 424px. Radix's popper hard-sets `min-width:
              max-content` on its wrapper, so without a ceiling the surface simply takes
              that width and hangs off the screen — and because a popover is
              `position: fixed`, there is no page scroll to go and get it
              (ACCESSIBILITY §10, RESPONSIVE.md 9).

              Radix's own available-width variable is that ceiling, and it is the reason
              this does not reproduce here while it still does under `DateRangePicker`,
              which sets no max width at all. `collisionPadding` keeps the surface off
              the viewport edge rather than flush against it.

              **Height needs the same ceiling now that the surface has a floor.** Two
              stacked months are 512px of calendar on a phone, and a footer under them
              put Apply at 834px down a 820px viewport — off the bottom of a
              `position: fixed` surface, which no amount of page scrolling reaches
              (measured at 375×820 before this line). So the content stops at the height
              Radix says is available, the calendar takes the scrolling, and the footer
              keeps its place at the bottom: the one action is on screen at every size.

               over the trigger's padding, the label above it — so Radix's dismissable
               layer dismisses on both. Radix excludes the trigger itself
               (`targetIsTrigger`) and nothing else, which is how clearing used to cost
               the calendar (`ds-requests` 19(e)), and it is why a plain `label` would
               close the surface on pointer-down and then reopen it when the browser
               forwarded the click on to the button — a flicker that can never be shut.

               Refusing the dismiss for both fixes both: the `×` clears and the surface
               the bench is still reading stays put; the label's forwarded click reaches
               the trigger with the popover still open, so it toggles shut the way

 * do" by making the days the subject, and it cost the thing a record is for: a bench

 *
 * So the record is the board's own table with that column restored, and the several days
 * a session may hold are answered inside it: the column header filters (`NewDateFilter`),
 * and the line above says how much of the record is on screen.
 *
 * **Nothing here states a count.** A line above the table did, twice over: at rest it
 * repeated the tab strip's own total, and narrowed it reported the window the filter had
 * made. Both went (owner, 2026-09-16, on each in turn), and the second one's job is done
 * instead by what is already on screen — every row in the column reading one date, and a

 *
 * **And now they read as one window, which they did not.** The frame was rebuilt on the
 * registrations overlay's interaction at the owner's instruction (2026-09-16: *"right now
 * it abruptly changes to a new modal — that shouldn't happen at all, everything should
 * happen in one modal with all those motion+interaction"*). Three things were doing the
 * damage, and all three are measured on the render before this:
 *
 * - **The window resized under the reader.** The calendar stage stood 640px tall, the
 *   signing stage 258px, the outcome 448px — and because a dialog is centred, each change
 *   moved the whole panel up or down the screen as well (top 130 → 321 → 226). The stage
 *   canvas now carries a floor, so pressing on does not shrink the window by 382px.
 * - **Nothing moved, so nothing said a stage had changed.** The body was swapped where it
 *   stood. It now travels: `STAGE_SLIDE`, forward from the right, back from the left,
 *   with the header and footer holding still — that is what makes them chrome rather than
 *   part of the thing that changed.
 * - **The frame itself disappeared at the end.** The header was dropped on the outcome so
 *   the success panel could carry its own heading, which is precisely the moment the
 *   overlay stopped looking like the overlay. The header now states every stage,
 *   including the outcome, and the panel below it no longer repeats itself.
 *
 * **The outcome settles in the scene it was signed in; it does not arrive in a new one.**
 * Signing does not slide, because nothing progressed — the card the bench is looking at
 * stays exactly where it is and a band resolves across the top of it. The second screen
 * is the first screen with a stamp on it, which is the registrations overlay's own rule
 * (owner, 2026-09-11: approving *"takes two screens that feel like one act"*) and as close
 * to one step as a signed act honestly gets.
 *
 * **What that cost, and why it is still the product's confirmation.** The old ending was
 * the detached solid `bg-success` panel carrying its own heading and tick, with the facts
 * in a sunken well beneath — the shape the advocate side ends a submission on
 * (`cases/add-signature-dialog.tsx`) and every court-side signing queue ends on
 * (`sign-bulk-confirm-dialog.tsx`), adopted on 2026-09-15 because a bulk act and a
 * submission must not end on two different kinds of object, and a toast invented for this
 * screen alone was exactly that. That ruling stands and the object still holds: solid
 * success fill, a tick, and the facts directly under it. What changed is that it is the
 * top band of the card those facts were already in rather than a panel that replaces the
 * window — the composition survives the frame staying up, and the heading moves to the
 * header because two headings saying one outcome is one too many. The queues
 * (`sign-bulk-confirm-dialog.tsx`, which still swaps its content wholesale) are the next
 * ones to bring across; that is a separate pass and is not done here.
 *
 * **The signature is the finalisation, and nothing moves before it.** Anshumanth's note
 * (2026-09-15) is that a bulk reschedule needs a document drawn up and signed before it
 * is finalised — which is how the act actually works: a court moves twenty matters by
 * passing one order, and the order is what the files carry. So picking a date commits
 * nothing; the matters move when the signature goes on.
 *
 * **It is an e-sign, and it asks for nothing.** No method group, because there is no
 * second route to choose between — the order is drawn up by the court at the moment of
 * the act, so there is no paper to upload — and no code, because the bench is not
 * authenticating a document it has opened. Pressing Sign signs, the way the court's own
 * bulk path does (`sign-bulk-confirm-dialog.tsx`, which asks for neither).
 *
 * The order document itself (`bulk-reschedule.ts`) is drawn up and tested but has no
 * surface on this screen: the bench is not offered a copy before signing or after it.
 *
 * **The calendar is composed here rather than hidden behind a picker trigger.** Three
 * things fall out of that, and each was a defect on the version this replaces. A day
 * already past can be refused by the control instead of by a sentence after the fact —
 * `DatePicker` takes no matcher, so the screen used to catch a past date and complain
 * about it. The date is written out by the court's own registers (`formatCourtDay`)
 * rather than by the picker's fixed `en-US` trigger, which disagreed with every other
 * date on the page. And a stage whose whole question is "which day" should not open a
 * second layer to ask it.

/**
 * What is about to be signed, and — **in the same card, in the same place** — what was.
 *
 * One object across the last two stages of the act. Before the signature it states the
 * move: a strip naming what the bench is doing, over the three facts it cannot get
 * anywhere else at this moment, having come from a board it has already scrolled away
 * from. After it, the identical rows stay exactly where they are and the strip resolves
 * into the outcome. Nothing is replaced, nothing collapses, and the only thing that moves
 * is the band that changed — which is the registrations overlay's rule, borrowed with its
 * reason (owner, 2026-09-11 and 2026-09-16).
 *
 * **The copy is the owner's, and it is a sentence the card finishes** (2026-09-16):
 * *Preparing to move* across the top, then *Cases* and *To new hearing date* under it. The
 * band is the verb and the rows are its object, so the bench reads one line rather than
 * three labels — which is what the first pass got wrong by stating the move as a heading
 * ("You are rescheduling") over three unrelated facts.
 *
 * **Two rows, because the third was the same number twice.** A *Hearings* row sat above
 * *Cases* and on this board they are almost always equal, so it read as the card saying
 * one thing twice (owner, 2026-09-16). The count of listings is not lost: the first
 * question's title carries it going in, and the receipt's title carries it coming out.
 * Where listings do outnumber cases, this card states the cases only.
 *
 * **The band is the product's success treatment, at the size a band can carry it.** Solid
 * `bg-success` with the tick and its own ink, the facts directly beneath — the composition
 * the advocate submission and the signing queues end on (2026-09-15). What it is not is a
 * detached panel that replaces the window and carries its own heading: the heading is the
 * dialog's, because the frame stays up now, and a 40px tick chip inside a 40px-tall strip
 * would be the whole strip.
 *
 * Before the act the strip is white over a rule rather than a tint — the tint it would
 * otherwise carry is the stage's own tone, which is how the top of a card ends up
 * dissolving into the page (measured on the registrations overlay, 2026-09-11) — and the
 * words are the plain "what you are about to do", never a colour.
 *
 * **The facts do not change across the act, and are not read from live state after it.**
 * Signing empties the selection, so the case count comes from the captured `Outcome` once
 * there is one; passed in rather than read here, because this card is the one place both
 * sides of the act are stated and it must not be able to disagree with itself. The e-sign asks for nothing further — no method, no code — the way the court's
 * own bulk path signs a queue (`sign-bulk-confirm-dialog.tsx`, which asks for neither).

          September 2026* 176px to live in and broke a court date across two lines inside a
          448px dialog (measured). Sizing the column to its content gives the date the rest
          of the card, and the list owning the columns is what keeps the two rows aligned
          with each other while it does.

          **On a phone the pair stacks instead.** Two columns inside a 280px card leave
          the date 136px however tightly the term is measured, and it broke across two
          lines again; stacked, it has the card's full width and reads as one date. The
          rows keep the list's columns through `grid-cols-subgrid`, so one breakpoint on
          the list turns both of them. */}
