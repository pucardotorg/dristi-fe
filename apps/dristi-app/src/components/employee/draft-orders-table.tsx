/**
 * The orders open at today's sitting, drawn the way today's cause list draws the same
 * listings: the court's serial, the cause, its number, who appears, what it was listed
 * for, where it stands, and the order on it.
 *
 * **The same seven columns as `HearingsTable` in the typist's seat, on the owner's
 * instruction (2026-09-16)** — and composed out of that table's own cells rather than
 * beside them, so the two cannot drift: `CounselCell` for the advocates, the cause list's
 * own status variants, and `HearingOrdersButton` for the Orders column, which is where
 * the draft plate and the recorded tick already live. This tab is a view of the day's
 * board filtered to the matters with an order on them, so it should look like the board.
 *
 * What it is not is the cause list. There are no session controls in any seat: the bench
 * calls a matter from the cause list, and a screen in the Sign group that offered Start
 * hearing would be a second place to run the sitting. The Orders column is the row's one
 * act, which is the shape the typist's own cause list already takes.
 *
 * **No checkbox, either.** A draft cannot be signed, in bulk or at all: it has not been
 * sent for signature, and the act that finishes it is the composer's own. A column of
 * boxes feeding no button would offer an act this tab cannot perform.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table is
 * one panel rather than a box inside a box.
