 * `md`. What lives here is only what is the bench's — the four groups of work, which of
 * them the court can actually reach yet, and who is sitting.

 * step on the ladder — the micro steps (`1.5`, `2.5`) are for inside controls, not between
 * them — and it costs about 84px of scroll on a column that already overflows, which is

           **The red spark is gone** (owner, 2026-09-23: the rail "adds a lot of visual
           noise now"). It was adopted from the advocate rail's `TasksCount`, which had
           already been pulled back from a full red pill because that "read as an alarm
           bolted to the nav" — and the comment that stood here admitted the rest: that
           `--rail-badge` resolves to `--destructive-solid`, which the DS reserves for
           irreversible or dangerous actions, and that a signing queue is workload, not
           danger. The 6px dot was the concession that kept the red anyway.

           It does not survive the open layout. That concession was priced against a rail
           where one family disclosed at a time, so about seven sparks were on screen; with
           every queue visible there are seventeen, and a mark that appears on every row
           with work discriminates between nothing. This rail already makes that exact
           argument against four red dots on the folded strip (`CourtNavGroupMark`) — it
           was simply never applied to the expanded state. The numeral was always the
           thing carrying the count.

           The ink has to change with the row's ground. Idle, the numeral sits on the
           charcoal plate at `--rail-muted` (6.28:1). Selected, the row inverts to the
           white card and the same ink would fall to 2.08:1 — so it switches to the
           plate's `--rail-card-muted` (5.70:1), which `CARD` names for exactly this.
           `text-caption` carries the DS's 500 weight floor, so the numeral also stays
           at one weight while the selected row's label goes to 600.

           There is no folded register for it, because no folded row carries one: the only
           rows the strip renders are the two standalone links, and neither has a count.
           Where a count goes in a folded rail is answered in `CourtNavGroupMark` —
           nowhere, and for a reason. This hides it rather than trusting that, so a row
           that gains a count tomorrow cannot quietly squeeze four digits into 40px. */

 * in view — so which section is open has to be right without being asked for.
 *
 * **The route answers it, and is re-asked on every navigation.** Landing anywhere in the

 * a deep link, a press on the folded strip, or a link a screen offers to somewhere outside
 * its own section. Between navigations the magistrate may open any other section and that
 * choice stands — reading the Sign queues from a hearings screen is an ordinary thing to
 * want, and a rail that sprang back would be unusable. The next navigation derives again,
 * because arriving somewhere new is precisely when "where am I" is the live question.

 * `/employee` belongs to no section, so the court's home opens none: two links above four
 * shut headers. Picking one there would be an opinion about what a magistrate does first,
 * which is not something this build knows — and `courtTrail` says the same thing about the
 * same route by carrying no trail on it.
 *
 * All four shut is therefore a state the rail already has to be able to hold, which
 * settles the other end of it: pressing the open section's header closes it and leaves
 * none open. A header that refused would be a control that does nothing, and the rail
 * would be claiming a section is open because it has run out of ways to say otherwise.
 *
 * The area's layout outlives every route change inside it, so this state is never
 * remounted and a navigation cannot be inferred from mount order. The pathname it was
 * last derived from is kept beside it, which is what tells a navigation apart from an
 * ordinary re-render. Adjusting during render rather than in an effect is deliberate: the
 * section that opens has to be right in the same paint as the screen behind it, not one

 * do not flatten into their own contents — so there is no version of this strip that
 * shows the rows at all. Four marks and two links is the whole of what 4rem can hold, and
 * it turns out to be the right thing to say: which kind of work you are in, and how to
 * get back to the rest of it.
 *
 * So the mark answers "where am I" by taking the selected card whenever the page open is
 * one of its rows, and pressing it opens the rail on that section rather than toggling a
 * disclosure the strip has no room to show. A flyout listing the rows beside the strip
 * would say more, but it invents an interaction this product has nowhere else — and the
 * rail is already the disclosure, so it is one press either way.
 *
 * It is a button standing on its own, not a one-item list. A section header is not a list
 * item in the open rail either — it is a `SidebarGroupLabel`, a `div` — and wrapping each
 * of the four in its own `ul` to reuse the row primitives would have a screen reader
 * announce "list, 1 item" four times down a strip of six squares.
 *
 * **No count marks here.** The open rail annotates a *queue* with its length; a section
 * stands for three to six of them, and their sum is a figure this product states nowhere
 * — Sign alone runs to four digits on a 20px glyph. The alternative, a bare dot for "work
 * is waiting", is worse than nothing: all four sections have work waiting and always do,
 * so four red dots on six squares would discriminate between exactly nothing while
 * spending the rail's whole budget for alarm. Workload is what the magistrate opens the
 * rail to read; folded, it carries where-you-are and the way back.

/**
 * A group of rows behind its own disclosure. One section open at a time; the whole header
 * toggles. Which one that is belongs to the rail — see `useCourtNavDisclosure` — because
 * a section can no longer decide it alone.
 *
 * **Still `Collapsible`, and the DS `Accordion` was read before that was kept.** Single
 * open plus the disclosure semantics is what `type="single" collapsible` exists to give,
 * so it was the first candidate and it does not survive contact with this rail. Its
 * trigger renders its own pair of chevrons as children, with no prop to withhold them,
 * and this header's sign is a plus and a minus for a stated reason; suppressing a
 * primitive's glyph in order to draw a different one is editing it at a distance. Its
 * content pane styles descendant anchors with an underline, which every row in a section
 * is. And an item is only operable through that trigger, while these headers swap to
 * `CourtNavGroupMark` when the rail folds — a control that opens the rail rather than a
 * disclosure, and one that must not be wearing accordion semantics while it does. Its
 * root also moves a roving tab stop between the four triggers, which in a column where
 * links sit between the headers would take the arrow keys away from half the rail. That
 * is four overrides and a semantic mismatch to buy a behaviour that is one shared piece
 * of state. Radix `Collapsible` already carries the whole of the disclosure contract the
 * accordion pattern asks of a header — `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and a panel that
 * leaves the document — so what is coordinated here is which section is open, not the
 * accessibility of a section. The DS accordion is a prose component; this is chrome.
 *
 * No nested `SidebarGroup`: each one carries `p-2`, and stacking a group per section
 * doubled the air between "All cases" and "Hearings" (and between every closed
 * disclosure) while the rows inside a menu only had `gap-1`. The outer group owns the
 * inset; this section is just another beat in that same `gap-1` column.
 *
 * The toggle is a plus when the group is shut and a minus when it is open — the sign
 * names what pressing it does, which a chevron only implies. It is decorative on purpose:
 * `aria-expanded` on the header already carries the state, and announcing the glyph too
 * would say the same thing twice and disagree with it half the time.
 *
 * The disclosure is controlled rather than `defaultOpen` so that folding the rail is not
 * an opinion about it: the strip forces every section shut, and what each one returns to
 * is the state the rail is holding. Radix unmounts a closed section's rows, so the folded
 * strip holds no invisible links for the keyboard to walk into — which is also why the
 * header swaps component rather than hides. Hiding it would have left
 * `aria-expanded="true"` on a trigger whose panel is not in the document.
 *
 * **A shut section still says whether you are standing in it.** That is the bill single
 * open runs up: open Hearings from a signing queue and the selected row leaves with the
 * rows it sat among, and an expanded rail that shows the current page nowhere is worse
 * than the four open sections it replaced. The folded strip already answers this by
 * giving the mark the selected card; here the card is the wrong strength twice over —
 * it is the loudest mark the rail owns, sitting among open content rather than alone in a
 * strip, and the moment the section opens its own current row takes a card, so two would
 * be two answers to one question. The plate offers no fill between its ground and that
 * card except the hover fill, and hover and selection are deliberately different kinds of
 * mark in this rail, not two strengths of one. The ink is already at full strength on
 * every header. What is left is the weight, which is a strict part of what the selected
 * row does anyway — so the header goes semibold, and `aria-current` says the same thing
 * to a reader that cannot see it. Both only while the section is shut, so they hand the
 * question back to the row the instant the row can answer it.

/**
 * The rail's head: the mark at the page origin, and the control that folds the rail.
 *
 * The brand row is the bar's own height and carries the plate's seam, so the rule under it
 * and the rule under the top bar are one continuous line, in both rail widths.
 *
 * **The mark is pinned and the control is the one that gives way.** Folded, 4rem has room
 * for exactly one thing in this row, and the two candidates are not equals. A fold control
 * has somewhere else it can live — the bar carries it, as the advocate's does — while the
 * mark has nowhere: fold the rail with the mark hidden and DRISTI has no brand anywhere on
 * screen, on precisely the wide-table screens a magistrate spends the day in. The strip
 * below is also seven identical 40px squares on charcoal, and a mark at the top of it is a
 * different *kind* of thing, which is what makes a header read as a header rather than as
 * an eighth square. So this control leaves with the labels and the bar's takes over.
 *
 * **The glyph, not the lockup, in both states.** The lockup stacks "24×7 ON COURTS" under
 * the mark and the wordmark is 120 of its 735 viewBox units — at the 32px a 56px row can
 * spare, that is a 5px smudge, not a word. No height that fits this row makes it legible,
 * so the row carries the mark alone at both widths, as the advocate's rail does. `onDark`
 * follows the plate, not the app's mode — charcoal stays charcoal at night.
 *
 * In the sheet there is no trigger at all: the sheet appends its own close control at the
 * top right, and a second one 40px from it in the same row would overlap it and mean the
 * same thing. That gate is `isMobile` rather than a media query because it decides what to
 * *render*, and nothing depends on it being right before hydration — the sheet is shut at
 * first paint, and the column this also empties is `hidden` below `md`.

/**
 * The mark at the page origin, and which court this is.
 *
 * The court used to be the third line of the rail's foot, under the person and the seat.
 * It is not a fact about the person: `CURRENT_STAFF.court` is one value for the whole
 * deployment and `session.ts` carries it as a single string spelled the way a court
 * document prints it. Three facts will not fit two lines in a 148px column — the seat and
 * the court together run past 180px at caption size — so the one that is a constant moves
 * to the chrome and is stated once, beside the mark, where a constant belongs. The foot is
 * then exactly two lines and cannot grow a third however long a name or a seat's title
 * gets (owner, 2026-09-18).
 *
 * **A deviation worth recording.** The foot deliberately never truncated this string —
 * "an ellipsis here has nothing behind it", and every order the sign queues produce is
 * headed with the court — so it wrapped and the footer grew. This row is a fixed 56px
 * matched to the top bar, so it cannot grow, and the column here is no wider. The demo
 * value fits ("JMFC Court 1, Kollam" measures ~133px against ~152px available); a longer
 * bench truncates, and `title` is what stands behind the ellipsis that the foot had
 * nothing to offer. Folded, it goes `sr-only` rather than disappearing — the same trade
 * every other label in this rail makes when the strip takes over.

 * set is small enough to answer in place.
 *
 * **Four seats** (`COURT_SEATS`) — the same four `/employee/login` signs in to, so the
 * menu can always name the seat the person arrived in. Same rail, same queues, same
 * screens, nothing granted
 * and nothing hidden; what differs is what a cause-list row offers — the bench's session
 * controls, or a row that ends at its order (`court-role.ts`). Beyond the sitting, what a
 * typist's work is as against a bench clerk's comes from product, and this build must not
 * answer that by quietly showing a different app. The menu is honest by being small.
 *
 * **Rail layout** (`nav-layout.ts`) — four shapes for the same rail, kept side by side
 * (owner, 2026-09-21 and 2026-09-23) rather than settled on one: "All queues" is the
 * default and shows every queue with no disclosures at all; "Grouped by type" is the rail
 * as it was, four disclosures with one open at a time; "Today's actions" keeps hearings a
 * tab of its own and folds the rest into one row; "Today's schedule" folds hearings in
 * with that same rest instead — see `courtNavRowsFor`. A second section rather than a
 * second control, because both are one person's preference about how their own rail looks,
 * not two different kinds of setting.
 *
 * Both sections are radio groups rather than plain items: each is one mutually exclusive
 * answer, and the menu has to show which one is live without being opened twice. `w-auto
 * min-w-48` because the primitive otherwise inherits the trigger's width, and a 40px
 * trigger would pinch "Bench clerk" to a column of letters.
 *
 * The tooltip stays, and now names the control rather than excusing it. Its trigger
 * wraps the menu's so one button carries both — the hover name and the click.
 *
 * It leaves with the labels when the rail folds. A strip has room for one mark at its
 * foot, and that mark is the person.
