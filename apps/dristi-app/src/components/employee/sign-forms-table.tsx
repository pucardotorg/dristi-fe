/**
 * The signing queue as a table: which forms are picked for signature, the cause, its
 * number, which process the form belongs to, and when it was drawn up.
 *
 * Five columns, and the first one is the point of the screen. Unlike the other
 * court-side queues this table carries selection, because signing is the one court-side
 * act the reference does in bulk — a magistrate clears a queue of forty-five forms by
 * checking them, not by opening forty-five dialogs.
 *
 * **The row is not the click target here.** Its three sibling queues open a dialog from
 * anywhere on the row; this one cannot, because the row already owns a control. A row
 * that both selects and opens on the same click has to guess which the bench meant.
 * So the checkbox selects, the cause title opens, and nothing else in the row is
 * clickable — the reference's own division.
 *
 * There is no status column: a row in this queue is in exactly one state, waiting for
 * signature, so a chip repeating that on every row would carry no information. There is
 * no row menu either — sign is the only act, and it is already in two places.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table
 * is one panel rather than a box inside a box.
