/**
 * The matters in range, and which of them the bench has picked.
 *
 * **One table, two jobs, told apart by one prop.** The screen shows it twice, once per
 * tab (owner, 2026-09-15), and `selection` is what says which:
 *
 * - **Present — the Unscheduled board.** A checkbox column, and picked rows carry the
 *   design system's own selection band (`tableRowClass({ selectable })`) so a run of them
 *   paints as one block. The date column is *Hearing date*: where the matter stands.
 * - **Absent — the Scheduled record.** Nothing to pick, so no column for picking. The
 *   date column is *Previous hearing date*: where the matter came from, with
 *   *New hearing date* beside it for where it went. That second column is the record's
 *   subject, so it carries the weight and the first one is muted: the row reads left to
 *   right as the move it is.
 *
 * **The record is one table again** (owner, 2026-09-16). It was a stack of them, one per
 * day, under a date heading with its own tally — which made the day the thing to group by
 * and left a New hearing date column repeating its own heading on every row. One table
 * needs that column back, and the several days it may hold are answered by a filter in
 * its header rather than by cutting the table up (`newDate.days`, and see
 * `NewDateFilter`).
 *
 * The row itself stays inert either way — the checkbox is the control, and a hover fill
 * would promise a click the row does not answer.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table is
 * one panel rather than a box inside a box.
