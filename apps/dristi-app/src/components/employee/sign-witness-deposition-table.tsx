/**
 * The evidence queue as a table: which sheets are picked for signature, the cause, its
 * number, who was in the box, when the evidence was recorded, and who appeared.
 *
 * Six columns, in the reference's own order. The witness column is the one this table
 * has that no sibling queue does, and it is the column that does the work: a case with
 * four witnesses puts four rows in this list under one cause title, and the witness is
 * what tells them apart. Its `PW1` / `DW4` tag rides beside the name because that tag
 * is how the bench, the bar and the record all refer to the sheet — muted, because the
 * name is the fact and the tag is its label.
 *
 * **The row is not the click target here.** Its sibling queues open a dialog from
 * anywhere on the row; this one cannot, because the row already owns a control. A row
 * that both selects and opens on the same click has to guess which the bench meant. So
 * the checkbox selects, the cause title opens, and nothing else in the row is
 * clickable — the reference's own division.
 *
 * There is no status column: a row in this queue is in exactly one state, waiting for
 * signature, so a chip repeating that on every row would carry no information. There is
 * no row menu either — sign is the only act, and it is already in two places.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table
 * is one panel rather than a box inside a box.
