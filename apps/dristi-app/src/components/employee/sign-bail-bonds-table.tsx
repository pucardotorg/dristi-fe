/**
 * The signing queue for bail bonds as a table: which bonds are picked for signature, the
 * cause, its number, and the litigant bound by each one.
 *
 * Four columns — the reference's own four. No status column, because every row on this
 * screen has the same status: signing or rejecting a bond drops it from the queue, so a
 * column that read "Pending signature" all the way down would be a column that never
 * says anything (`lib/employee/sign-bail-bonds.ts`). No date column either; the
 * reference draws none, and the date the bond binds the litigant to appear is in the
 * bond, where it belongs.
 *
 * **Two rows can be the same case.** A case with two accused carries two bonds, and the
 * litigant is the only thing telling those rows apart — the reference shows exactly that,
 * and it is why this queue has a Litigant column at all. So the litigant is named inside
 * the opener's accessible name and inside the checkbox's, and not left to the column
 * header: a bench reading with the screen, and one listening to it, both have to be able
 * to tell which of a case's two bonds they are about to sign.
 *
 * **The case name is the opener, not the litigant.** The reference underlines that column
 * and no other, and it is the right one: the bond is read to check the case it belongs
 * to. Selection is the first column, because signing is the one court-side act the
 * reference does in bulk — a magistrate clears a queue of sixty-eight bonds by checking
 * them, not by opening sixty-eight dialogs.
 *
 * **The row is not the click target.** Its sibling review queues open a dialog from
 * anywhere on the row; this one cannot, because the row already owns a checkbox, and a
 * row that both selects and opens on one click has to guess which the bench meant. So the
 * checkbox selects, the case name opens, and nothing else in the row is clickable.
 *
 * There is no row menu. The reference draws none here, and every act it could hold is
 * already on the screen — signing is the checkbox and the bar, Reject and Download live
 * inside the preview the case name opens.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table is
 * one panel rather than a box inside a box.
