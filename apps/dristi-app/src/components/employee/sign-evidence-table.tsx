/**
 * The evidence signing queue as a table: which markings are picked for signature, the
 * cause, its number, the document that was marked, and the exhibit number it took.
 *
 * Five columns, and selection is the first one, because signing is the one court-side act
 * the reference does in bulk — a magistrate clears a queue of twenty-five markings by
 * checking them, not by opening twenty-five dialogs. Both signing queues beside it work
 * the same way for the same reason.
 *
 * **The cause title opens the row, as the reference draws it — but it is not what
 * identifies one.** Five rows of this queue are the same case, told apart only by the
 * document and the exhibit number beside the name. So the name keeps the reference's
 * click, and the *accessible* name of that button carries the document and the number:
 * five links reading "Mustanki Cooperative Co. v. Rajesh Varma" and nothing else is a
 * screen reader being handed five identical choices for five different acts
 * (ACCESSIBILITY §2, §9). That is the one deviation in this table, and it is additive —
 * nothing on screen changes.
 *
 * There is no status column: a row in this queue is in exactly one state, waiting for
 * signature, so a chip repeating that on every row would carry no information. There is
 * no row menu either — signing is already in two places, and changing a marking lives
 * inside the dialog the name opens, beside the facts it changes.
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table is
 * one panel rather than a box inside a box.
