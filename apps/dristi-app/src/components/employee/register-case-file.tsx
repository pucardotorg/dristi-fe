/**
 * The case file — everything the complaint was filed with, for a magistrate who is not
 * going to scrutinise it but may want to check one thing.
 *
 * **Not a workspace** (owner, 2026-09-11, on the three-pane build: *"it's almost like a
 * scrutiny officer view… it shouldn't look like another workspace… the magistrate is not
 * gonna really go and scrutinize things here. He just wants to quickly verify something,
 * if at all"*). So the file is a page that scrolls, in the same grammar as the summary —
 * a section eyebrow over one lifted panel, groups inside it, label beside value — and the
 * three ways to check something sit around it rather than in panes of their own:
 *
 * - **Search**, as the queues search: the file narrows as you type to the particulars and
 *   documents that match, with the match marked in each.
 * - **Contents**, as a rail of quiet ticks beside the file (owner's reference): one tick
 *   per group, the one you are reading darker; hover or tab into it and the group names
 *   open over it in a card.
 * - **The page, on request** — a panel beside the file, sticky as the file scrolls (the
 *   "floating preview" of the first build, owner's note). At rest it is the list of
 *   documents; pick one, or a particular that was read from one, and it shows that page
 *   with the values read from it listed underneath, so a value is checked against its
 *   source without leaving the line you were on. Below 1280px the same panel is a sheet.
