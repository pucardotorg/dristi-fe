 * particulars, numbered operative paragraphs, a prayer, and who filed it when.

 * are all this shape, which is why the bench reads one kind of paper across three

/**
 * The overlay a bench reviews one application in, and answers.
 *
 * Document-first: the particulars a bench checks first sit in a compact sunken
 * well, and the application itself is a preview taking the whole height beside
 * them. Stacked, the well ate the first fold and left the document a strip you had
 * to open Full view to read; from `xl` the two stand side by side, so a page of the
 * application is on screen at once. The split waits for `xl` because the rail takes
 * 17rem off the page column first — below that width neither column gets a usable
 * measure, so they stack. Download is not repeated in the footer — the preview owns
 * a sticky header with Download and Full view in it — so the footer carries only
 * the two decisions the overlay exists to take.
 *
 * The shell is shared rather than copied per queue. Three queues asking the same
 * question of the same kind of paper should not drift into three overlays; what
 * each one supplies is its own header line, its own facts, and what happens when
 * the bench answers.
 *
 * **Approving and rejecting here perform no judicial act.** Every caller drops the
 * row from its demo queue and closes. No order is drawn, no listing moves, nothing
 * is written and nobody is told.
