/**
 * The signing queue for orders as a table: which orders are picked for signature, the
 * cause, its number, which decision the order carries, whether the signature is already
 * on it, and when it was drawn up.
 *
 * Six columns, and selection is the first one, because signing is the one court-side act
 * the reference does in bulk — a magistrate clears a queue of eighteen orders by
 * checking them, not by opening eighteen dialogs. `SignFormsTable` beside it works the
 * same way for the same reason.
 *
 * **The cause name opens the row, matching Sign forms.** The title is still the fact
 * that tells four rows of one case apart, so it stays in its own column as plain text.
 * The click lives on the cause, and the accessible name of that button carries the
 * title as well, so four links are not read as the same case four times
 * (ACCESSIBILITY §2, §9).
 *
 * **The case name and its number stay two columns.** The reference joins them into one
 * ("AdvocateTest and 1 Other vs Automate Company , ST/198/2026"); every court-side queue
 * we have splits them, and a bench scanning a column of numbers should not have to read
 * past a party name to find one (owner instruction, 2026-09-03).
 *
 * **A pointer on the rest of the row opens it too.** The checkbox still selects, and
 * keyboard still lands on the case name — a row that was itself a button would steal
 * the checkbox's target and add a second tab stop. Mouse and touch do not have that
 * problem, so a click anywhere else on the row opens the order, matching Sign forms
 * from the first column the bench reaches (owner, 2026-09-06).
 *
 * There is no row menu. The reference draws a kebab in a trailing Actions column, but
 * every act it could hold is already here — signing is the checkbox and the dialog, and
 * Download lives inside the preview the case name opens — so it would be furniture
 * around a hole (deviation logged in the build report).
 *
 * The panel shell (border, fill, shadow) lives on the screen around this, so the table
 * is one panel rather than a box inside a box.
