 * the `sidebar_state` cookie at the provider, so a second one would leave both toggling
 * two rails at once.
 *
 * Nav width follows the route: labels on the list, the icon rail inside an act flow. The
 * state is keyed by area, so a toggle holds for as long as the person stays in that area
 * and is not overridden on every render.
 *
 * `topBar` lets an area bring its own bar (the filings flow has a draft breadcrumb and
 * a sections-rail toggle no other area needs) while everything else — rail, theme,
 * profile, fold behaviour — stays the one shell. This is the unification seam: an area
 * customises the bar, never the rail.
