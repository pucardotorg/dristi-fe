/**
 * The product's toaster: one placement, one set of fills, mounted once per area.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `components/ui/sonner.tsx` is a synced DS primitive. It maps each variant to a token
 * pair — `--success-bg: var(--success-muted)` and so on — and a local edit there is lost
 * at the next sync and fails the sync gate in the meantime. So the product's own
 * decisions are composed on here instead, and every area mounts this rather than the
 * primitive. One file to change when the treatment changes.
 *
 * ## Placement (owner, 2026-09-16)
 *
 * Bottom centre, 56px up, and centred on the *page column* rather than the window.
 *
 * Sonner's default is 24px into the bottom-*right* corner, which is where a macOS dock, a
 * Windows taskbar and any floating window sit — the toast was landing underneath the
 * furniture, at the furthest point on a wide screen from wherever the eye just was. 40px
 * cleared a standard taskbar and still read low, so it stands at 56.
 *
 * Centring is the part sonner cannot do: its bottom-centre is the viewport's centre, and
 * the viewport starts up to 16rem left of where the work does, so under a wide rail the
 * toast leaned. The horizontal shift is one rule in `globals.css` reading
 * `--chrome-page-inset` off the column this is mounted in — which is why this component
 * belongs inside the shell rather than beside it. On a phone the rail is off-canvas and
 * the window is the page, so neither the shift nor the raise applies; `mobileOffset`
 * keeps the safe area clear instead.
 *
 * ## Fills and edges (owner, 2026-09-16, revised 2026-09-17)
 *
 * The primitive sets `--success-border` to the *same* token as `--success-bg`, so a
 * success or error toast had no edge at all and the neutral one was white on white, held
 * up by nothing but a shadow. That is the real defect, and the edge is what makes the
 * toast an object: a step-3 tint on white is a 1.1:1 surface, which the eye cannot find.
 *
 * The fill was bumped one ramp step first, and that is now reverted. It buys about 0.1 of
 * surface contrast and costs real text contrast — against a step-4 fill the inks fall to
 * 4.24:1 (success), 4.07:1 (error) and 4.37:1 (info), all under the 4.5:1 that this 13px
 * text owes, and the DS's own `check-contrast` would have refused it. So the statuses sit
 * on `--*-muted` with the ink already paired to them, which measures 4.54-4.88:1.
 *
 * The neutral variant sits on `--surface-sunken` rather than `--popover`. On `--popover`
 * it was the page's own white in light mode and its own near-black in dark — a 1.00:1
 * surface both times. It is the variant that carries an acknowledgement, which is what
 * copying an identifier raises, so it is the one most calls land on.
 *
 * **The borders are the one thing still stated as ramp steps here.** The DS names them
 * `--{status}-muted-edge`, but that family arrived after the pin this app builds against,
 * so until `ds:bump` carries it these read `var(--success-7)` and so on. When the pin
 * moves, they become the token name and this file gets shorter.
 *
 * `style` and `toastOptions` are *replacements*, not merges — the primitive spreads
 * `{...props}` after its own, so whatever arrives here wins outright. That is why the
 * whole variable set is restated below rather than only the six values that changed:
 * passing a partial object would drop the rest of the DS's mapping on the floor.
