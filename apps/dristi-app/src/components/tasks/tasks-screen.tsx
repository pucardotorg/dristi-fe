 * The selection bar: what is ticked, said in a sentence, and everything that can be

 *
 * Its first shape put the count and all four controls in a left-aligned row, which left
 * the right two thirds of the bar empty and gave the primary act no more standing than
 * Clear beside it — the owner's "un-UX-ly" (2026-09-16). This is the shape the court's
 * own sign queues use: the summary muted and left, in a live region so the selection is
 * heard as well as seen; the acts grouped hard right, least consequential first and the
 * primary last, carrying the count or the money it will charge.
 *
 * Clear belongs with the count, not with the acts — it undoes the selection rather than
 * doing anything to the tasks — so the right-hand group is acts only.
