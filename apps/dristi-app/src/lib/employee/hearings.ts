/**
 * Today's cause list — what this bench is sitting on, as data.
 *
 * The employee area is self-contained by design (see `content.ts`): nothing under
 * `/employee` reads from the citizen side and nothing there reads from here. So the
 * hearing vocabulary is restated in this module rather than imported from
 * `lib/cases/hearings.ts`. The *words* are deliberately the same ones — a hearing is
 * "scheduled" or "completed" and its purpose is "Admission" whichever side of the app is
 * looking at it — because the two halves must not drift into disagreeing about the same
 * §138 listing. Only the coupling is avoided, never the shared meaning. Passed over is
 * a sitting overlay this side owns; the citizen hearing record does not carry it yet.
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `CAUSE_LIST` is one sitting day of demo rows, shaped to
 * exercise what the screen has to survive: a purpose long enough to wrap its column, a
 * corporate accused long enough to wrap the cause title, sides with one counsel and
 * sides with several, and enough rows to page at 10 and 20. No row is read from a case,
 * a court or a queue.
 *
 * **The board opens before the court has sat**, every listing still to be called
 * (owner, 2026-09-16). The day starts where the bench starts: nothing heard, nothing
 * drawn up, and every mark on this screen made by the person at it. A board that opened
 * part-heard had the first thing it is for — Start hearing, on a matter that has not
 * been called — already done on half the rows, and an order can only follow a sitting,
 * so a completed listing here would arrive carrying one nobody wrote.
 *
 * **Starting, ending, and passing over are screen actions, not a court record.** The
 * listing stands as scheduled until the bench presses Start hearing; only then does
 * the chip read ongoing, and that matter's case overview opens over the list — the
 * glance the advocate list already ships, as an overlay the day sits behind. End
 * hearing, on the same control, marks that listing completed. Pass over, from the row overflow, marks it
 * passed over — to be heard on a later date — without completing it. Nothing is
 * filed, notified, or written back. Choosing that later date is Bulk reschedule /
 * Schedule, not this mark.
 *
 * The three marks themselves live in `hearing-session.ts`, because the cause title
 * and the order composer both navigate and the screen holding them does not survive
 * the trip. Where they are kept changed; what they claim did not.
