/**
 * Forms waiting on this bench's signature — the signing queue, as data.
 *
 * The sibling of `register-cases.ts`, `schedule.ts` and `rescheduling-request.ts`.
 * Those queues are cases waiting for an act of judgment: to be taken on file, given a
 * date, or answered. This one is the act's *last step* — a form the court has already
 * drawn up, sitting unsigned until the magistrate puts a signature on it. It shares the
 * court-side vocabulary (counsel, sides, the cause title, the page sizes, the listing
 * date format) rather than restating it. Only the citizen side is off limits (see
 * `content.ts`).
 *
 * **There is no backend and nothing here is signed.** `SIGN_FORM_QUEUE` is demo data
 * shaped to exercise what the screen has to survive: all three process types, a
 * corporate accused long enough to wrap the cause title, a side with no vakalat, dates
 * spread across months so the date filter has something to cut on, and enough rows to
 * page at 10, 20 and 30. No row is read from a case, a court or a signing service.
 *
 * **Signing is a screen action, not a court record.** Neither the bulk path nor the
 * single-document path applies a signature, calls an e-sign provider, writes a
 * document, or notifies anyone. Both do exactly one thing: drop the row from this demo
 * queue, the way Approve and Reject already do on the rescheduling queue. The
 * confirmation copy describes what signing *means* so the control is not misread; the
 * build performs none of it.
 *
 * **The form wording is demo text, not a court-approved form.** It is modelled on the
 * affidavit the reference screens show and filled from each row's own particulars. No
 * §138 form template is defined in `docs/product/`, so this module writes one for the
 * preview to have something real-shaped to render and claims nothing more about it.
 *
 * Numbers are `ST/…` and `CMP/…` both: a form can be drawn up before cognizance (a
 * mediation reference on a complaint still numbered CMP) or after it. These rows do not
 * overlap today's cause list, the scheduling queue, the register queue or the
 * rescheduling queue.
