/**
 * Who the court side is running as — the one thing `/employee/login` decides.
 *
 * **Session-lite, not authentication.** Nothing here checks a credential or guards a
 * route: a person who types a court URL still reaches it, exactly as they did before the
 * sign-in existed. What the sign-in establishes is the *identity the chrome reports* —
 * the name at the foot of the rail, the seat it names, and the bench and district that
 * every order and form the sign queues produce is headed with. That is a real thing for
 * a screen to know and it had nowhere to live.
 *
 * It replaces the fixed `CURRENT_STAFF` as the thing screens read, and it subsumes the
 * old seat store: `court-role.ts` is now a view onto this one, so the rail's settings
 * control and the sign-in cannot disagree about the same visit.
 *
 * **It survives a reload**, which the seat store deliberately did not. That bargain was
 * right while the seat was a switch inside one visit; it is wrong for a sign-in, because
 * refreshing a court screen and finding yourself signed in as somebody else is not a
 * demo of anything. It lives in `localStorage`, so it is per-browser and per-device and
 * carries no authority whatsoever.
 *
 * Read it through `components/employee/use-court-session.ts`, never directly from a
 * render — the hook is what subscribes, and what keeps the server's first paint and the
 * browser's hydration agreeing on the default before the stored session replaces it.
