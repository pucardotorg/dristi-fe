/**
 * Process the court has issued — summons, notices, warrants and proclamations — from the
 * moment it waits on a cover to the moment its channel reports back, as data.
 *
 * **Three tabs, cut by who the process is waiting on** (owner, 2026-10-06). The line
 * used to be five tabs, one per stage, which made three of them statuses of the same
 * thing and sent the bench across tabs to do one job. What actually changes the work is
 * whose move it is:
 *
 * - **RPAD collection** waits on the advocate. A registered-post process cannot be signed
 *   until its cover is in the court's hands; nothing else waits here.
 * - **Issuance** waits on the court. Everything to sign, from every channel; the
 *   registered-post covers that are signed and still to be taken to the post office; and
 *   any electronic send the channel refused. A process leaves this tab only when it has
 *   actually left the court.
 * - **Service** waits on the channel: out, and then back — completed or failed.
 *
 * Inside a tab, the statuses are pills, not tabs: one at a time, with All to see the tab
 * whole. The tab is the job; the pill narrows it.
 *
 * **Signing is not sending for registered post** (owner, 2026-10-06). An electronic
 * channel goes out the moment the process is signed — SMS, email, the police through
 * ICOPS. A registered-post cover is signed in a batch and taken to the post office later,
 * so it waits under *To post* until someone marks it posted. A send can also fail before
 * the process ever leaves (ICOPS not answering); that is still the court's to fix, so it
 * waits under *Send failed* in the same tab, not under Service.
 *
 * **What came back is the channel's word, and only registered post is recorded by hand.**
 * Electronic channels report their own outcome. A registered-post acknowledgement comes
 * back to the court as paper, and the clerk records it — in bulk, from the stack of
 * returned covers, using the same type-the-number-then-Enter gesture the covers came in
 * by. The case file's Notice/Process status section (`lib/cases/process-status.ts`) is
 * the party-by-party record of service; this is the court's own worklist.
 *
 * **There is no backend and nothing here is signed, sent, posted or served.**
 * `PROCESS_LINE` is demo data, and every act below moves a row's status in memory and
 * stamps a day. The one demo-only field, `demoSendFailure`, is how the line shows where a
 * refused send lands; a real channel decides that for itself.
 *
 * **The process wording is demo text, not court-approved process** — see
 * `buildProcessDocument`. Numbers are `ST/…` and `CMP/…` both: process can issue before
 * cognizance (a §223 notice on a complaint still numbered CMP) or after it.
