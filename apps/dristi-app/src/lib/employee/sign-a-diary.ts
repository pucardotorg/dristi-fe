/**
 * The A-Diary entries waiting on this bench's signature — the day's register, as data.
 *
 * The third row of the rail's Sign group, and a different kind of paper from the two
 * above it. A form is a court paper a party swears; an order is the court's own
 * decision. The A-Diary is the court's **register of its own day**: for every matter the
 * bench dealt with, what was done and when the case comes back. It is written as the day
 * runs and signed at the end of it, and until the magistrate signs it the day's record
 * is not made.
 *
 * Two facts follow from that and shape everything here:
 *
 * 1. **An entry is dated, and the diary is read one day at a time.** So the screen's one
 *    filter is a date, opening on the day the court is sitting — the reference's own
 *    control — and the entries carry the day they record rather than a created-on
 *    timestamp.
 * 2. **The business of the day is editable until it is signed.** Every other court-side
 *    queue shows a finished paper and asks only whether to act on it. This one is the
 *    record itself, so the bench can correct the words before putting a signature under
 *    them. `saveBusinessOfTheDay` is that edit.
 *
 * **There is no backend. Nothing here is signed, filed or recorded.** `A_DIARY_SEED` is
 * demo data shaped to exercise what the screen has to survive: a day with enough entries
 * to read as a register, a short backlog on earlier days so the date filter has
 * something to cut on, a business line long enough to clamp in its column and to wrap in
 * the editor, a corporate party long enough to wrap the cause title, and a side with no
 * vakalat so the appearance table has an empty row to answer for. No row is read from a
 * case, a court or a register.
 *
 * **The dates are offsets, not fixtures.** A diary pinned to a date in 2026 is empty
 * every morning after that date, and a screen that opens on today would show nothing
 * forever. `bulk-reschedule.ts` reached the same conclusion for the same reason; the
 * offsets here are resolved against the reader's own clock by `aDiaryEntries`.
 *
 * **This does not read today's cause list**, though the diary of a real court is the
 * record of exactly those matters. `CAUSE_LIST` holds one day of listings, and what the
 * bench actually *did* with each of them — heard, passed over, still to be called — is
 * state that lives in the hearings screen for the length of a visit. A diary derived
 * from it would hold three entries, and would empty or contradict itself the moment
 * either side changed. So this module keeps its own matters, and they are its own: no
 * entry here restates a case on today's board, the scheduling queue, the register queue,
 * either review queue, or the two signing queues above it.
