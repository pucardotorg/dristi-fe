/**
 * The orders a day-order can carry — now the court's catalogue, not this app's.
 *
 * This file used to hold seventeen English sentences written here, with a comment saying
 * so: *"The standing words are this app's, not a court's. No template library was given
 * to us."* One was given to us on 2026-09-13. The words now come from
 * `order-templates.ts`, which transcribes the court's own twenty-seven templates, and
 * this module is the thin layer between that catalogue and the draft the composer holds.
 *
 * **What an order opens on is its BOTD line with the auto-fill pass run over it.**
 * *(Corrected 2026-09-14. This comment used to say none of the twenty-seven references a
 * general variable and there was therefore nothing to fill — read off the six* name *rows
 * of the spec's general-variables table, which has thirteen. `[Application Number]`,
 * `[Hearing Purpose]` and the hearing dates are general or context variables and they are
 * all over the catalogue.)*
 *
 * What is still **not** filled, and this part of the old comment stands: which party is
 * summoned and what a cost is set at are choices, and the spec is explicit that the
 * system cannot make them — *"The system cannot fill a variable when it requires a choice
 * among multiple options."* The old build wrote "Issue summons to Anand Traders" and read
 * as finished while nobody had chosen anything, so `[Party Type]`, `[Party Name]`,
 * `[Amount]` and the discretionary dates keep their brackets and wait for D31's fields.

/**
 * **The mark that ties a passage in the order to the row that pulled it in.**
 *
 * The composer had no Remove for a pulled-in order until 2026-09-16, and the reason was
 * sound: the words become part of one passage the moment they land, so a Remove would
 * have had to *guess* which sentences were once a template's, and would either take out
 * text the typist had since written or leave text it claimed to have removed.
 *
 * The mark answers the objection instead of overriding it. The paragraph a template
 * writes carries the item's id, so the passage can be found exactly — and, just as
 * importantly, the reverse question can be asked exactly too: a row belongs in *Pulled
 * into this order* while a marked paragraph for it survives in the body, and not after.
 * A typist who selects the direction in the editor and deletes it has removed the row by
 * removing what the row was a record of (owner, 2026-09-16).
 *
 * It rides in the markup because that is the only thing the editor round-trips: the
 * field emits `innerHTML` verbatim (`components/cases/rich-text-field.tsx`), so an
 * attribute on a block survives typing inside it, splitting it, and formatting it, and
 * disappears exactly when the block does. Editing the *words* inside the paragraph
 * therefore keeps the row, which is the honest reading — the direction is still in the
 * order, in the court's or the typist's words.
 *
 * The one case it cannot answer: a browser command that replaces the block rather than
 * editing it — turning the paragraph into a list item, on some engines — drops the
 * attribute with it, and the row goes while the words stay. A row that has lost its
 * passage is the safer failure of the two, since the words are on the page beside it
 * where they can be read and deleted by hand.
