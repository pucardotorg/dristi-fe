/**
 * Bail bonds waiting on this bench's signature — the signing queue for bonds, as data.
 *
 * The third sibling of `sign-forms.ts` and `sign-orders.ts`, one row below them in the
 * same rail group. A form is a court paper drawn up for a party to swear; an order is
 * the court's own decision; a bail bond is the undertaking an accused executes, with a
 * surety, to appear on every date this case is adjourned to. It is not a bond until the
 * magistrate signs it. So this queue is shaped like the other two — the same court-side
 * vocabulary, the same page sizes, the same demo-data honesty — and differs in the two
 * facts the reference screens add.
 *
 * **The litigant is the row.** Every other court-side queue is one row per case. This one
 * is not: a case with two accused carries two bonds, one per accused, and the only thing
 * telling those rows apart is who executed each one. That is why the reference gives this
 * queue a Litigant column and no status column, and why `ST/822/2026` appears twice
 * below.
 *
 * **The bench's only filter is the case.** The reference puts one control on this screen
 * — "Case Name or Number" — and no status, date or type filter. So `SignBailBondFilters`
 * holds one field, and a bond leaves the queue when it is signed or rejected rather than
 * staying behind a status the screen has no control to reach.
 *
 * **There is no backend and nothing here is signed, published or filed.** Neither the
 * bulk path nor the single-bond path applies a signature, publishes anything, calls an
 * e-sign provider, writes a document or notifies anyone. `signSelectedBailBonds` and
 * `rejectBailBond` do exactly one thing each: move a row's status in this demo queue, the
 * way Approve and Reject already do on the rescheduling queue. The confirmation copy
 * describes what signing *means* so the control is not misread; the build performs none
 * of it.
 *
 * **The bond wording is demo text, not a court-approved bail bond form.** `docs/product/`
 * defines no §138 bond template, and this module invents no statutory citation, no form
 * number and no rule. What it does carry, unlike `sign-orders.ts`, is a **sum**: a bail
 * bond whose whole substance is the amount bound cannot recite "the sum this court has
 * fixed" and still read as a bond, so each row carries a demo figure as data and the
 * facsimile prints the row's own. Those figures are invented for this screen and mean
 * nothing. Same for the sureties and the dates of appearance.
 *
 * `SIGN_BAIL_BOND_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to exercise what the screen has to survive:
 * one case carrying two bonds under different accused (the reference's own case, and the
 * reason Litigant is a column), corporate complainants long enough to wrap a cell, both
 * `ST/…` and `CMP/…` numbers, and enough rows to page at 10, 20 and 30. These rows do not
 * overlap today's cause list, the scheduling queue, the register queue, the rescheduling
 * queue, the other-applications queue or the signing queues for forms and orders.
