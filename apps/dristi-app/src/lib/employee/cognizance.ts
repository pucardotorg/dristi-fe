/**
 * Complaints on the register waiting for the magistrate to take cognizance — the queue,
 * and the sheet of facts behind each row.
 *
 * The sibling of `register-cases.ts`, one step later in a complaint's life. That module
 * is complaints not yet on the register, and the question its screen asks is *is this
 * file right* — the magistrate reading behind the scrutiny officer, with a send-back at
 * the end of it. This one is complaints already registered, and the question is a
 * different one: *should this case go ahead*. Same court, same vocabulary, same
 * furniture; a different act, hours later (owner, 2026-09-14).
 *
 * Registering is **not** taking cognizance. Registering puts a complaint on the register
 * and gives it a number; cognizance is the judicial act that follows, and it is what
 * turns a `CMP/…` into an `ST/…` (`schedule.ts`, `other-applications.ts`). The register
 * screen used to say otherwise in as many words; it no longer does.
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `COGNIZANCE_QUEUE` is demo data, and every date on a file is
 * *derived from its row* rather than transcribed — the same bargain `case-review.ts`
 * strikes, for the same three reasons: every row has to open a file, the §138 chain has
 * to hold together backwards from one anchor, and thirty files sharing one cheque date
 * is the first thing a clerk would spot. Nothing here is read from a case or a court.
 *
 * **One knob per fact that matters.** A row carries `filedAfterCauseDays`, and the delay
 * the queue's column shows and the delay the file's block shows are both read off it —
 * so the list and the screen it opens cannot disagree about whether a complaint was
 * late. Same for the notice window and the branch: the check and the fact it is read
 * from come from one value, never from two that have to be kept in step.
 *
 * **One fact on this screen has no field behind it yet.** *Date of receipt of information
 * about return* — the day the payee learnt the cheque had bounced — is what the thirty
 * days in §138(b) run from, and `DemandNotice` / `ChequeDetails` in `lib/filing/types.ts`
 * do not carry it. Our own memo reader already hunts for it (`lib/filing/ocr/parse-memo.ts`
 * looks for *intimation date*, *date of receipt*, *informed on*) and drops it on the floor
 * for want of somewhere to put it. Until that field lands, this module derives the date
 * with the rest of the chain and the notice check is computed from the derived value.
 * The owner parked the filing-form change on 2026-09-14; this comment is the marker for
 * when it is picked up.
 *
 * Terms are the PRD's own field names, in sentence case because the DS Laws do not keep
 * Title Case. The three checks are the PRD's three, and their sentences are quoted from
 * it rather than rewritten.
