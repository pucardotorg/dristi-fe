/**
 * Court-staff sign-in — the roles on offer, the demo directory behind them, and the
 * posting a staff member signs in to.
 *
 * **This is scaffolding for a directory, not an authenticator.** The real screen (the
 * owner's reference, 2026-09-14) asks for a username and a password because every court
 * user is registered in the establishment's own back end — there is no self-registration
 * on the court side and no OTP. Until that endpoint exists, this module stands in for it
 * and does the one thing the screen cannot be judged without: it makes each role a
 * sign-in that a person can actually perform in a demo. Delete it with the endpoint.
 *
 **The username decides the seat, and nothing on the screen can override it** — the
 * same contract the real back end has. A role picker was tried first and cut the same
 * day (owner, 2026-09-14): staff sign in for each other constantly, a bench clerk into
 * the magistrate's account to get a thing done, and asking every one of those sign-ins
 * to declare a role first taxes them for a fact the directory already holds.
 *
 * **Any password is accepted.** The same bargain the citizen sign-in makes: there is
 * nothing to check a password against, and a screen that rejected one would be inventing
 * a rule. The field is real, required and masked; what it is not is checked.
