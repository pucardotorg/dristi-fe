/**
 * Advocate registrations waiting on the scrutiny officer — the eighth court-side queue,
 * as data.
 *
 * Advocates **self-register** on the citizen side. Their account sits at Pending Approval
 * with no access to it (`REG-24`), and this queue is what stands between them and the
 * right to file. The act the officer performs is the one the Account Creation handover
 * names in §2: verify the person by their **Bar registration ID and the photo of their
 * Bar ID card**, then approve or reject (§5.3). A rejection carries a free-text reason
 * (`REG-22`); the advocate edits and resubmits, without limit (`REG-23`).
 *
 * This is **not** a form for keying an advocate's details in. Nothing on the court side
 * creates a registration; every row here arrived from the other side of the product.
 *
 * Source for every field and every state below:
 * `/Users/abhiramrajilan/Desktop/account-creation-handover.md` §5 (`REG-10`–`REG-24`) and
 * `docs/design/proposals/approve-registrations.md`. Only what the registration flow actually
 * collects is modelled — mobile (OTP-verified, the account's primary key), full name, Bar
 * registration ID, the photo of the card, and an optional email. **Address, ID type and
 * ID proof are deliberately absent**: handover §5.1 says they are not collected, and a
 * row that carried them would be inventing data the product never asks for.
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `REGISTRATIONS_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to exercise
 * what the screen has to survive: two names in Malayalam script, one name long enough to
 * wrap its column twice, Bar registration IDs from four state bars so the column is sized
 * off the longest rather than off Kerala's short form, waits spread from one day to two
 * months, an edited pre-created account (`REG-18`) whose changed name is also the one the
 * register disagrees with — so a request carrying **both** comparison tables at once
 * exists in the data and not only in the brief — a resubmission at round 2 and one at
 * round 5 with every earlier reason kept, a register that could not be reached, one that
 * holds no entry, one mismatch where the register answers in a different script from the
 * claim, and one card photo that will not load. Between them the rows reach all three
 * `RegisterAnswer` values and the silent fourth case where the register simply agreed,
 * which is the coverage the overlay has to be exercised against.
 * No row is read from a bar council, a register or a person.
 *
 * **Approve and Reject perform no act.** Neither opens an account, grants access, refuses
 * anyone, sends a reason or writes to a record. Both do exactly one thing: drop the row
 * from this demo queue, the way the copy-application and rescheduling queues already do.
 * Nothing persists past a reload.
 *
 * The registration application number stays in the `KL-ADV-000207-2026` form the advocate
 * is shown on their own "awaiting approval" screen. It is the only string the two sides of
 * the product share about this request, so it is not re-minted here (brief D14).

  /* ─── Advocate clerks (`REG-13a`, `REG-14a`) ───────────────────────────────────────
     Same five values, their own identifier, their own card, and **no lookup** — the
     handover names no register for clerks. Application numbers take the sign-up's own
     `KL-CLERK-` series (`registration-flow.tsx`, `applicationId`). No clerk is an
     `edited` request: `REG-17`/`REG-18` pre-create accounts from the Bar Council
     database, which holds advocates.

     **The registration-number format is a placeholder.** The sign-up's clerk field has
     no example ("Your clerk registration number") where the advocate's shows
     "K/1234/2020", so there is no source to copy. `CLK/serial/year` is shaped like the
     Bar numbers so the column sizes sensibly; it is not a claimed format (brief §12.12). */
