/**
 * Witness depositions waiting on this bench's signature — the evidence sheets, as data.
 *
 * The fifth row of the rail's Sign group, and the sibling of `sign-forms.ts`,
 * `sign-orders.ts` and `sign-a-diary.ts`. Those three are a paper a party swears, a
 * decision the court makes, and the register of the court's own day. This one is
 * **evidence**: what a witness said in the box, taken down as they said it. Until the
 * magistrate signs the sheet the evidence is not on record, which is why a queue of
 * unsigned depositions is a queue that stops trials.
 *
 * Two facts about depositions shape the module:
 *
 * 1. **A deposition belongs to a witness, not to a case.** One case yields as many
 *    sheets as it has witnesses, and a witness examined over two sittings yields two.
 *    So the row is the deposition and the case number repeats down the column — the
 *    reference's own list shows the same case twice, and the witness name is the column
 *    that tells the two rows apart.
 * 2. **The court numbers its witnesses.** `PW1` is the complainant's first witness,
 *    `DW4` the defence's fourth, and that tag is how the bench, the bar and the record
 *    all refer to the sheet. `witnessTag` derives it rather than storing it, so a row
 *    cannot carry a tag that disagrees with its own side.
 *
 * **There is no backend and nothing here is signed or published.** `WITNESS_DEPOSITION_QUEUE`
 * is demo data shaped to exercise what the screen has to survive: all five kinds of
 * witness the §138 box actually sees, both sides' numbering, two cases carrying two
 * sheets each, a corporate party long enough to wrap the cause title, a side with no
 * vakalat so the advocates cell has to answer for an empty side, a witness name long
 * enough to wrap its column, cross-examination completed, declined and deferred, and
 * enough rows to page at 10, 20 and 30. No row is read from a case, a court or a
 * register.
 *
 * **The deposition wording is demo text, not a court-approved form.** It is modelled on
 * the deposition sheet the reference screens show and filled from each row's own
 * particulars. `docs/product/` defines no §138 deposition template, so this module
 * writes one for the preview to have something real-shaped to render and claims nothing
 * more about it. The statutory citation in the heading is the reference's own.
 *
 * Every number is `ST/…`: evidence is recorded at trial, after a complaint has been
 * taken on file and given a summary-trial number, so a `CMP/…` deposition would be a
 * sheet from a stage the case has not reached. No number here appears in today's cause
 * list, the scheduling queue, the register queue, either review queue, or the signing
 * queues above it. The *parties* are a different matter: this court's queues share one
 * local cast, so the same firm or the same bar appears across them, and two §138 cases
 * between the same parties is the ordinary case rather than a fixture mistake — the
 * filing form asks about exactly that. What no row does is put one person in two
 * incompatible roles.
