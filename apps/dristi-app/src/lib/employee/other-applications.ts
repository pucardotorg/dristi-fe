/**
 * Every other application waiting on the bench — the third review queue, as data.
 *
 * The sibling of `rescheduling-request.ts` and `delay-condonation.ts`: those two
 * modules are one kind of application each, and this one is the rest. It shares the
 * court-side vocabulary — counsel, sides, the cause title, the page sizes, the stage
 * labels — rather than restating it. Only the citizen side is off limits (see
 * `content.ts`).
 *
 * **"Others" is not "everything except the two rows above it in the rail."** The
 * reference's Others table lists rows of type `RE_SCHEDULE` and `DELAY_CONDONATION`
 * alongside the rest, so this is the court's view of *all* applications, and the type
 * list keeps reschedule for that reason. The two narrower queues are that same body of
 * work pre-filtered for the bench, not slices carved out of it.
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `OTHER_APPLICATIONS_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to exercise
 * what the screen has to survive: every application type at least once, every stage the
 * filter offers, the two longest type labels in the vocabulary, a corporate accused long
 * enough to wrap the cause title, sides with several counsel, and applications with no
 * vakalat on record at all. No row is read from a case, a court or a queue.
 *
 * **Nothing here decides anything.** Allowing or rejecting an application is a real
 * judicial act and this build performs none, so the table carries no row actions at all
 * (see `OtherApplicationsTable`) — not even disabled ones. The list is honest about what
 * is waiting; the act is simply not offered yet.
 *
 * Numbers follow the stage: `CMP/…` before cognizance is taken, `ST/…` after. These rows
 * do not overlap today's cause list, the scheduling queue, the register queue, the
 * rescheduling queue or the delay-condonation queue.

 * **Journey order, not the reference's alphabetical.** The reference sorted these
 * A–Z, which puts Judgement above Plea and Scrutiny below Registration. Every other
 * court-side list in this app is ordered the way the process runs
 * (`docs/product/domain/journey.md`), and a court reads stages in process order — so the
 * filter opens in that order and the deviation is deliberate.
