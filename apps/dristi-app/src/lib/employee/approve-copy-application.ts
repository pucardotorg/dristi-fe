/**
 * Copy applications waiting on this bench's approval — the seventh court-side queue, as
 * data.
 *
 * A copy application is a party asking the court for a certified copy of something on
 * the record: the judgement, an order, a witness's deposition, a marked exhibit, or the
 * complaint itself. The office prepares the copy; the bench first has to allow the
 * application. This module is that queue.
 *
 * It is the sibling of `sign-forms.ts`, `sign-orders.ts` and `rescheduling-request.ts`,
 * and it shares the court-side vocabulary — counsel, sides, the cause title, the page
 * sizes, the column date format — rather than restating it. Only the citizen side is off
 * limits (see `content.ts`).
 *
 * **`docs/product/` does not define copy applications for §138.** The only mentions are
 * passing ones in `docs/design/research/pending-tasks-ux.md` and
 * `docs/design/proposals/pending-tasks.md`. So everything below — the vocabulary, the
 * wording of the application, the folio counts, the amounts tendered — is demo text
 * modelled so the preview has something real-shaped to render. **No rule, form number or
 * fee schedule is quoted or implied**, and none should be read into the figures: a copy
 * application in a real court is priced by a schedule this build has never seen.
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `COPY_APPLICATION_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to exercise what
 * the screen has to survive: all five kinds of record, a corporate petitioner long enough
 * to wrap its column, a record description long enough to wrap three lines, three
 * applicants with no counsel on record, applications raised across ten months so the list
 * pages at 10, 20 and 30, and application serials that reset with the year. No row is
 * read from a case, a court or a copying section.
 *
 * **Accept and Reject perform no judicial act.** Neither allows nor refuses anything,
 * neither issues a copy, assesses a fee, notifies the applicant or writes to a record.
 * Both do exactly one thing: drop the row from this demo queue, the way Approve and
 * Reject already do on the rescheduling queue and the way signing does on the two signing
 * queues. Nothing persists past a reload.
 *
 * Numbers follow the stage the record belongs to: a judgement, a deposition and a marked
 * exhibit only exist once the case is on file, so those rows are numbered `ST/…`; the
 * complaint and an early order can be asked for before that, so those rows are both.
 * These matters do not overlap today's cause list, the scheduling queue, the register
 * queue, the rescheduling queue, the delay-condonation queue, the Others queue or either
 * signing queue.
