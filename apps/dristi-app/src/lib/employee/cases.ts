/**
 * This court's register — every case on its file, and the priorities the bench reads it
 * through.
 *
 * The screen it feeds is `/employee`, which is the dashboard and the case register at
 * once (owner, 2026-09-14: *"I think we can combine the dashboard and all cases list"*).
 * That combination is why this module holds both halves: the six priority categories are
 * not a separate analytic, they are saved filters over the same rows the table shows, so
 * a tile's count and the list it opens cannot disagree.
 *
 * ## Where the six categories came from
 *
 * The owner's field visit to Gujarat (2026-09-14). Judges there asked for exactly this
 * and explicitly did not ask for general analytics or broad pendency numbers on the
 * landing screen: what they want is instant awareness of the matters that need judicial
 * action now or are under a higher court's mandate. All six are transcribed from that
 * research and none is invented here.
 *
 * Two of them are **derived, not stored** — the register already knew them:
 *
 * - *Newly filed, pending cognizance* is `stage === "cognizance"`. A case that has
 *   cleared registry scrutiny and not yet been taken on file is at that stage by
 *   definition (`hearings.ts`, `CourtCaseStage`).
 * - *Process issued, report awaited* is `stage === "process"`, for the same reason: the
 *   stage means summons or warrant has gone out and the serving report has not come back.
 *
 * The other four are facts the model did not carry, so they are a flag set on the case.
 * They are properties of the matter rather than of its stage — a stayed case is stayed at
 * whatever stage it had reached — which is why they cannot be folded into `CourtCaseStage`.
 *
 * ## Demo data, and honest about which parts
 *
 * There is no backend. The 23 cases listed for today are transcribed from `CAUSE_LIST`
 * so the dashboard and the cause list cannot name the same case two ways — `cases.test.ts`
 * asserts it — and the rest are this court's older file. Dates are stored as offsets from
 * today rather than as fixed days, so a demo opened next month still shows a court with
 * dates in front of it rather than a screen of expired listings.

 * "1 year 2 months", "3 months", "18 days" — how long a case has been on the file.
 *
 * Rounded to the unit a court would say out loud: days below a month, whole months below
 * a year, then years and the remaining months, with the second unit dropped when it is
 * zero so nothing reads "1 year 0 months".
 *
 * **A year is 365 days here and a month is 30, deliberately.** Deriving months from the
 * astronomical 30.44 and then taking years out of *those* makes 365 days read as "11
 * months", which is not what anybody means by a case that was filed a year ago today.
 * This is a phrase a person says about a file, not an interval calculation.
