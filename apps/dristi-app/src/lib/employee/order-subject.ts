/**
 * What an order is being passed *on* — the one thing the composer needs to know, and the
 * only thing that differs between the two places a court draws one up.
 *
 * The composer used to be a hearing screen. It opened at
 * `/employee/hearings/<id>/order`, looked the hearing up, and everything on it read off
 * that object: the attendance of the people who appeared, the applications pending on
 * the listing, the item number on the day's cause list. A complaint waiting for
 * cognizance has none of those — it has never been called — so the screen could not
 * mount for it at all. Hiding two panels would not have helped; the lookup fails first.
 *
 * So the subject is named, and the blocks read the subject rather than a hearing:
 *
 * - a **hearing** — a matter called on today's list, with people who appeared and
 *   applications waiting on it;
 * - a **complaint at cognizance** — on the register, never listed, carrying one act the
 *   bench has chosen from its file.
 *
 * Everything an order actually needs — the cause, the numbers, who is on record — both
 * of them have. What only a hearing has is asked for through the accessors below, and
 * they answer *nothing* for a complaint rather than making one up. A block that has no
 * data does not render; no mode flag decides it, so the two cannot drift apart.
