/**
 * What the bench navigates between, as data.
 *
 * The shape of the court-side rail — two standalone links, then four groups of work —
 * is transcribed from the magistrate's reference screens. It is deliberately data and
 * not markup: the rail renders whatever is here, so a row's destination, its count or
 * its position is a change to this file rather than to a component.
 *
 * **Most of it is not wired yet.** The three Hearings rows, all five Actions rows —
 * Scrutinise submitted cases, Register cases, Take cognizance, Approve copy application
 * and Register advocates — all three Review applications rows —
 * Rescheduling request, Delay condonation and Others — and all seven of the Sign rows —
 * Sign forms, Sign orders, Sign process, Sign bail bonds, Sign witness deposition, Sign
 * evidence and Sign A-Diary — have an `href`, and they point at the court-side routes
 * that exist. Every other row is a real, focusable control that says plainly it goes
 * nowhere — no stub routes, no hrefs that 404. Giving a row its destination later is the
 * one `href` line below.
 *
 * **The counts are demo data, with a few exceptions.** They are the reference's numbers,
 * kept so the rail can be judged at the widths it will really see (`1312` is the one that
 * decides how a row truncates). None of these labels describes an action this build
 * performs. The exceptions are the built rows whose counts are derived from the lists
 * they lead to (`lib/employee/hearings.ts`, `lib/employee/schedule.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/register-cases.ts`, `lib/employee/cognizance.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/approve-copy-application.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/approve-registrations.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/rescheduling-request.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/delay-condonation.ts`, `lib/employee/other-applications.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/sign-forms.ts`, `lib/employee/sign-orders.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/sign-process.ts`, `lib/employee/sign-bail-bonds.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/sign-witness-deposition.ts`, `lib/employee/sign-evidence.ts`,
 * `lib/employee/sign-a-diary.ts`) — still demo data
 * underneath, but a real count of it, so the rail cannot claim a different number from
 * the screen it opens. Sign orders counts only what is still pending, because that
 * screen also holds the orders this bench has signed; Sign process counts only the three
 * stages of its line that still need an act, for the same reason.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the court's, taken from the reference — a copy application, a delay
 * condonation, the A-Diary. `docs/product/` does not yet define these for §138, so this
 * module names them and claims nothing more about what they do.

 * would eventually disagree — a route the rail lit up and the trail could not name, or
 * the reverse.
 *
 * It returns the record's **identifier**, never its cause title. The title is the page's
 * own `h1`, several sizes down and a few pixels below; a crumb repeating it would restate
 * the loudest type on the screen in the quietest, which is the defect the old
 * omit-the-page convention was written to avoid. A case number does not restate anything.

/*
 * **There is no `leaf` any more** (`register-cases` brief D25). Register cases was the
 * one queue with a step *past* the record: its complaint split in two, the glance at
 * `/<id>` and the whole file at `/<id>/file`, and a trail ending at the case number on
 * both could not say which of the two a magistrate was on. The file is now a disclosure
 * of the complaint's own route rather than a second page, so there is one view again and
 * the trail ends at the case number. The field's own comment said *a leaf is added when a
 * route earns one*; the route stopped earning it, so it goes rather than sitting here
 * with nobody to answer for it.

 * convention until then was the opposite — the page was never a step — on the argument
 * that each queue screen opens with a heading that is its rail label word for word, so a
 * last crumb would restate the loudest type on the screen in the quietest. That argument
 * is still true of the *queue* screens and is now overruled for the whole area, because
 * it was never true of the nested ones and because a trail whose last step is somewhere
 * else is a trail that reads as unfinished. The nested pages are where it earns itself:
 * their heading is a cause title, and the crumb carries the case number instead — an
 * identifier no heading on the page repeats.
 *
 * It reads the rail's own data, so a section renamed in `COURT_NAV_GROUPS` is renamed in
 * the trail by the same edit. Nothing below names a section, a queue or a record.
 *
 * **There is no root crumb** (owner, 2026-09-14). Every trail used to open with
 * `Court home`, which was a placeholder screen nothing else linked to; when that screen
 * became the dashboard, rooting every trail at it would have put a page nobody routinely
 * opens at the head of every other page, and rooting them at the landing — the day's
 * cause list — would have read as if signing orders happened underneath today's hearings.
 * Neither is true, so the trail starts where the work is. The rail is what gets you
 * anywhere; the trail says where you are and lets you climb one step.
 *
 * Three shapes come out of it:
 *
 * - `/employee` and any other route with no section — no trail at all. The bar keeps its
 *   fill and its seam and carries nothing, which is what chrome looks like at a
 *   destination with nothing above it. A route this file does not know gets the same
 *   answer: the current step is omitted rather than guessed, because a crumb naming a
 *   page this file cannot identify would be an invented label.
 * - `/employee/sign-orders` — `Sign`, then **`Sign orders`** as the current page. The
 *   section is still text: it has no page of its own.
 * - `/employee/hearings/<id>`, `/employee/hearings/<id>/order`,
 *   `/employee/scrutiny/<filing no.>`, `/employee/register-cases/<id>` — the section, the
 *   queue, then the record: `ST/241/2026`, `F/AHM/2026/00341`, `CMP/1840/2025`. Both of
 *   the middle steps link back to the queue, which is where the record came from and, on
 *   a complaint's file, the whole of the way back — which is why that screen carries no
 *   back control of its own.
 *
 * The standalone Dashboard row is absent from every trail because nothing nests under it.
