/**
 * Complaints waiting to be registered — the court's intake queue, as data.
 *
 * The sibling of `schedule.ts` and `hearings.ts`: those modules are cases already on
 * file (waiting for a date, or listed today). This one is the queue *before* that —
 * complaints that have been submitted and have not yet been taken on the register.
 * They share the court-side vocabulary rather than restating it — counsel, sides, the
 * cause title, the page sizes all come from `hearings.ts`. Only the citizen side is
 * off limits (see `content.ts`).
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `REGISTER_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to exercise what the
 * screen has to survive: a wait long enough to dominate the column, a corporate accused
 * long enough to wrap the cause title, a side with several counsel, a complaint with
 * no vakalat on record at all, and enough rows to page at 10, 20 and 30. No row is
 * read from a case, a court or a queue.
 *
 * **Nothing here registers anything.** Taking a complaint on file is a real judicial
 * act and this build performs none, so the table carries no row actions at all (see
 * `RegisterCasesTable`) — not even disabled ones. The list is honest about what is
 * waiting; the act is simply not offered yet.
 *
 * Numbers are the filing number (`KL-NNNNNN-YYYY`), not a case number — a complaint
 * carries its filing number until the magistrate takes it on file, at which point it
 * is numbered as a summary trial (`ST/…`). These rows are all still waiting for that,
 * so there is no case number to show yet. They do not overlap the scheduling queue: a
 * complaint waiting to be registered is not also waiting for a hearing date.
