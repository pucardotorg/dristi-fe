/**
 * Whether a court-side filter form is asking for something narrower than a given baseline.
 *
 * This used to answer "has the Search button anything to do?", when every queue held the
 * controls in a `draft` and the table showed a separately `applied` copy. Those buttons
 * are gone — the queues filter as they are typed, from one state — and with them went
 * eleven of the twelve callers.
 *
 * What is left is the other question the same comparison answers, and the one worth
 * keeping: **is this view filtered at all?** A screen needs it to tell "nothing matches
 * what you asked for" apart from "there is nothing here", and `SignProcessScreen` needs it
 * against a per-tab default rather than against empty. Comparing to a baseline is still a
 * question with one right answer, so it still lives here rather than being re-derived.

 * matching — trailing space is not a search the bench meant to run.
 *
 * **Resolve defaulted fields before calling.** Where `null` means something other than
 * empty — "the day the court is sitting", on the screens that carry a date — an untouched
 * field and a deliberately picked today are the same request, and only the screen knows

 * offers one free-text box over a case, and a box that behaves differently on each screen
 * is a box the bench cannot learn.
 *
 * **Every token has to land, in any order and any amount of space.** The reference labels
 * these boxes "Case Name or Number", so the first thing a clerk does is read a name off
 * the Case name column and type it back — and a column prints a *cause title*,
 * "Girija Damodaran v. Sabu Chacko", which no single stored field contains. Matching one
 * contiguous substring against the parties separately therefore fails the most obvious
 * query on the screen, and so does a stray double space. Splitting the query and asking
 * that each part appear somewhere in the row fixes both, and costs nothing a clerk has to
 * know about.
 *
 * Pass the row's words as they are *shown* — the cause title, not the two parties — so
 * what is on screen is what can be found.
