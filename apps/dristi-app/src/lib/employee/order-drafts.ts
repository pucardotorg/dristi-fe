/**
 * What the bench has dictated on each listing so far, for the length of this sitting.
 *
 * It lives in a module rather than in the composer's own state because the composer
 * now advances: Next item ends this listing, calls the next, and routes to that
 * matter's composer — which unmounts this one. A draft kept in `React.useState` would
 * be gone the moment the bench moved on, on the one screen in this area whose whole
 * point is the text being written into it.
 *
 * **This is the bargain `hearing-session.ts` already makes, not a new one.** A client
 * module instance outlives client-side navigation inside `/employee`, so the words
 * survive the trip between items. They do not survive a reload and are not meant to:
 * nothing here is filed, notified, signed, or written back to a case. Moving the draft
 * out of a component changed how long it lives on one device; it changed nothing about
 * what it claims.
 *
 * The map opens empty — see `OPENING_DRAFTS` below.
 *
 * Read it through `components/employee/use-order-draft.ts`, never directly from a
 * render — the hook is what subscribes.
