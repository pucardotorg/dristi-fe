/**
 * Matters waiting for a hearing date — the scheduling worklist, as data.
 *
 * The sibling of `hearings.ts`: that module is the day the court is *sitting*, this one is
 * the queue of cases the court has not listed yet. They share the court-side vocabulary
 * rather than restating it — counsel, sides, the cause title, the page sizes all come from
 * `hearings.ts`, which the employee area already treats as the owner of those words. Only
 * the citizen side is off limits (see `content.ts`); inside `/employee` the two lists must
 * agree about what an advocate on record is.
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `SCHEDULING_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to exercise what the
 * screen has to survive: every stage, a corporate accused long enough to wrap the cause
 * title, sides with several counsel, and — the case that matters most here — matters at
 * cognizance where the accused has no counsel on record at all, because the accused has
 * not been called yet. No row is read from a case, a court or a queue.
 *
 * **Nothing here schedules anything.** Giving a matter a date is a real listing act and
 * this build performs none, so the table carries no row actions at all (see
 * `ScheduleTable`) — not even disabled ones. The list is honest about what the court is
 * owed; the act is simply not offered yet.

 *
 * The six the court lists from, drawn from the national journey
 * (`docs/product/domain/journey.md` §4–§8). Stages before cognizance — scrutiny, the
 * defect check — are the registry's queue and not a hearing to be given a date, so they
 * are not offered: a filter that can never match a row is a control that only ever
