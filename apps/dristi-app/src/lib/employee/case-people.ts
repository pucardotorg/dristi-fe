/**
 * The people on a case a process can be addressed to — every accused, the complainant
 * and the witnesses — with what their records hold for delivery: postal addresses, a
 * mobile number, an email address.
 *
 * The issue-process pop-up (`process-variables.ts`, `order-variable-dialog.tsx`)
 * pre-selects from this (`AUT-05`–`AUT-08` of `handovers/process-handover.md`), so it
 * has to know more than the one accused name a `CourtHearing` carries: whether there is
 * more than one accused, which witnesses are still to be examined, and whether the
 * accused has joined the case yet.
 *
 * **This is the seam for the party record, and the data behind it is demo data.** The
 * employee side stays self-contained (`order-draft.ts`), so the people below are its own
 * fixtures, keyed by case number, shaped to exercise each pre-selection rule: a company
 * accused with its person in charge (`PRC-02`), an accused with two addresses, a witness
 * list with exactly one witness unexamined, and one with two. Every other case falls
 * back to the single accused named on the listing, at one synthetic address. Nothing
 * here is anyone's real address or number.
