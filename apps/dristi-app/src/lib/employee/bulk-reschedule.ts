/**
 * The matters this court could move to another date — as data.
 *
 * Rescheduling in bulk is what a bench does when it is not going to sit: leave, transfer,
 * a court holiday declared late, a strike. The court pulls up everything listed across a
 * span of days and puts it on a new date in one act, rather than opening 20 case files.
 *
 * **There is no backend; the move is a demo move.** Confirming inside the overlay writes
 * the new date onto the matters for this session and nothing further — the board reads
 * back what the bench did, so the flow can be walked end to end, and that is the whole of
 * it. No notification is drawn up for the parties (the court's own
 * `notification-for-bulk-reschedule`), nobody is told, and nothing survives a reload. The
 * settled stage of the overlay says the second half of that out loud rather than letting
 * the screen imply the court has finished the act. Same bargain the registrations overlay
 * makes with its queue.
 *
 * **Today's rows are not restated here.** They are read out of `CAUSE_LIST` in
 * `./hearings`, so the two court-side screens cannot disagree about what this bench is
 * sitting on today. Only matters still `scheduled` are offered: one already heard,
 * abandoned or moved is not a matter this court can move again.
 *
 * The days after today are this module's own, and they are declared as **offsets** rather
 * than dates. A fixture pinned to 2026 goes stale the morning after it is written and
 * leaves the screen permanently empty; an offset is right whenever the screen is opened.
