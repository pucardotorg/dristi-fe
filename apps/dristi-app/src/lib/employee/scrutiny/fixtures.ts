 * The scrutiny queue.

 * Segmented by who holds the ball, because only one half of the list is the officer's
 * work. A clean resubmission does NOT bypass the officer: every refiling returns to
 * them, and they are the one who sends it to the judge — so there is no auto-register
 * state anywhere in this data.
 *
 * Fixture data, standing in for the registry service. It is the only thing here that a
 * real API replaces; the selectors in `queue.ts` and the screens above them are written
 * against the types, not against these rows.
