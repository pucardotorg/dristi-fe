/**
 * Advancement/reschedule applications waiting on the bench — the review
 * queue, as data.
 *
 * The sibling of `register-cases.ts` and `schedule.ts`: those modules are
 * complaints not yet on the register, and matters not yet given a date. This
 * one is cases already listed, where a party has asked to move the date. They
 * share the court-side vocabulary — counsel, sides, the cause title, the page
 * sizes, the listing-date format — rather than restating it. Only the citizen
 * side is off limits (see `content.ts`).
 *
 * **There is no backend.** `RESCHEDULING_QUEUE` is demo data shaped to
 * exercise what the screen has to survive: a corporate accused long enough to
 * wrap the cause title, a side with no vakalat, a request the other parties
 * have not agreed to, and a request that proposes two dates. No row is read
 * from a case, a court or a queue.
 *
 * **Approve and Reject do not write an order.** They only drop the row from
 * this demo queue. Moving the listed date is Bulk reschedule / Schedule; the
 * order composer is the place an order is drafted. This module names the
 * application and claims nothing more about what the bench's answer files.
 *
 * Numbers are `ST/…`. A listed hearing to reschedule is already on file; CMP
 * is the number *before* cognizance, and those complaints live on Register
 * cases. These rows do not overlap today's cause list, the scheduling queue,
 * or the register queue.
