 *
 * The roles are the judicial and ministerial roles the domain model names for a §138 trial
 * court (`docs/product/domain/actors.md`) — the magistrate takes cognizance and delivers
 * judgment, the bench clerk keeps the daily record and exhibits, the scrutiny officer
 * checks a filed complaint for defects before cognizance. No persona is invented here; who
 * actually logs in is still an open product question (`docs/product/open-questions.md`).

 * "Judicial Magistrate of the First Class / JMFC Court 1, Kollam".

/**
 * The seats the court side can be worked from — what the rail's settings control
 * switches between.
 *
 * All four, and it is `COURT_SIGN_IN_ROLES` that decides so: a seat a person can sign in
 * to at `/employee/login` is a seat the rail has to be able to name, and a switcher that
 * offered two of the four would leave a signed-in magistrate looking at a radio group
 * with nothing selected. It used to be two — `magistrate` and `scrutiny-officer` were
 * roles the domain model named that nobody had asked to sit in — and the sign-in is the
 * ask that changed it (owner, 2026-09-14).
 *
 * **`typist` is the owner's word, not the domain model's.** `docs/product/domain/
 * actors.md` names *Stenographer / Interpreter* for the person who records dictation and
 * has no separate typist; the owner asked for that seat by name on 2026-09-07, and an
 * owner naming a role is the one sanctioned source for one. Whether it is the same actor
 * under a court's own vocabulary is an open question for `actors.md`, not something this
 * constant gets to settle.
 *
 * Choosing a seat changes who the rail says you are and **what a row offers** — same
 * rail, same queues, same screens, and nothing granted or hidden: the cause list gives
 * the bench's three session controls to the seat that would use them and the typist a
 * row that ends at its order (`court-role.ts`, `hearings-table.tsx`). That is a view
 * rule and not a permission. What each seat's work actually is beyond the sitting is the
 * feature split that comes next, from product; until then the switch must not pretend to
 * be a different product.
