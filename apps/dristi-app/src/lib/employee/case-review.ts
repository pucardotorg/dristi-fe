/**
 * One complaint's own file — what the court reads before deciding whether to take it
 * on the register.
 *
 * The sibling of `hearing-overview.ts`: that module is the glance a bench takes at a
 * matter already on file, this one is the whole submitted complaint, section by
 * section, as the e-filing carried it. It is the screen behind a row of
 * `register-cases.ts`, and it is deliberately the *reading* of a complaint and not the
 * act on it — see `register-case-screen.tsx` for what the page does and does not offer.
 *
 * **There is no backend, and none of this is read from a case.** A complaint's
 * particulars are *derived from its queue row* — its `CMP` serial and how long it has
 * waited — rather than transcribed from a fixture per row. Three reasons, in order of
 * how much they matter:
 *
 * 1. **Every row opens a file.** Thirty-five complaints are waiting; a sidecar for six
 *    of them would leave twenty-nine dead links behind a cause title that now goes
 *    somewhere.
 * 2. **The dates hold together.** A §138 complaint is a chain — cheque drawn, deposited,
 *    returned, notice sent, notice served, fifteen days run, cause of action accrues,
 *    complaint filed within a month of that. Deriving the chain backwards from the one
 *    date the row already implies (today minus its wait) means every file is internally
 *    consistent and none of it drifts as the fixture sits, which is the same reason the
 *    queue stores a day count rather than a date.
 * 3. **A clerk would notice the alternative.** Thirty-five files sharing one cheque
 *    number is the first thing a real reader spots.
 *
 * What derivation cannot decide is which *state* a file is in — whether a document is
 * on record, whether there is a delay-condonation application, whether anyone deposed.
 * Those are the screen's unhappy paths, so they are named for particular rows in
 * `CASE_FILE_MARKS` and reachable from the queue rather than left to a modulo.
 *
 * **A derived value is demo data; a derived attribute is not** (brief §5a.8). Every
 * term this module names is an attribute the registry actually holds — the e-filing
 * contract in `lib/filing/types.ts`, a `docs/product/` citation, or a `REG-nn`
 * requirement — and the whole vocabulary is declared once in `FACT_TERMS` so it can be
 * checked rather than trusted. Nineteen rows that had no source, restated another row,
 * or were constant on every §138 complaint were cut in the 2026-09-10 revision; the
 * table in `docs/design/proposals/register-cases.md` §5a records each one.
 *
 * **The terms are the attributes' names, not the form's questions** (brief §5a.4a).
 * "Date when the fifteen days from service of the legal demand notice were complete" is
 * a question a form asks once; "Notice period ended" is what the court calls the fact
 * afterwards, and it is what survives translation into a column a reader can scan.
 *
 * **The reference's own values are not copied.** The legacy screen shows placeholder
 * filings — `asdf`, `dfgfdg`, a stylesheet pasted into the cheque-return reason. The
 * court side already speaks Kollam parties and `CMP` numbers
 * (`docs/design/proposals/register-cases.md` §6), and a third vocabulary would be the
 * first thing a clerk noticed.

 *
 * 1. **Nothing happens outside the wait.** The registry takes a complaint up a few days

 *    `[submittedOn, today]`. A scrutiny dated after the day the file reached this queue
 *    would be the report contradicting the header two panels up.
 * 2. **A complaint cannot have had more rounds than its wait can hold.** A file three
 *    days old has not been round the loop three times, whatever its mark says, so the
 *    round count is clamped to roughly three days a round. The mark records intent; the
 *    arithmetic keeps it coherent.
 * 3. **No tone, no threshold, no editorialising.** This returns numbers. Whether three
 *    rounds should *look* like anything is brief §12.19 and the owner's to answer; the
 *    machine does not tell a magistrate that three rounds is bad.
 *
 * `undefined` is the **"Not recorded"** branch: a complaint no scrutiny record can be
 * stated for. It cannot arise on demo data — every row in this queue has waited at least
 * a day — and it is the first state a real backend will produce, so the screen has to be
 * able to say it rather than quietly reading as cleared (brief §10, §11.3).
