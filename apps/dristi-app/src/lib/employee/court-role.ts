/**
 * Which seat the court side is being worked from — the rail's settings control, as data.
 *
 * It is a view onto the sign-in session (`session.ts`) rather than a store of its own.
 * That is a change: the seat used to be an independent switch that reset on every
 * reload, which was the honest bargain while nobody signed in. Now `/employee/login`
 * establishes the seat and the settings control changes it, and two stores would have
 * meant the rail's foot and a cause-list row disagreeing about the same visit. One
 * store, two doors into it.
 *
 * **It is still not a permission.** The sign-in establishes who the area reports itself
 * as; it authenticates nobody and guards nothing, so this grants nothing and hides
 * nothing. Every queue and screen is reachable in every seat today; what each seat's
 * work actually is comes from product, next.
 *
 * Read it through `components/employee/use-court-role.ts`, never directly from a
 * render — the hook is what subscribes.
