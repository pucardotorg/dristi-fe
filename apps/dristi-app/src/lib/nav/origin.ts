/**
 * Where the person came from, carried in the URL.
 *
 * The app has no back button, so the breadcrumb is the way back — and a breadcrumb that
 * describes a hierarchy instead of a journey sends people somewhere they have never
 * been. The scrutiny correction round is the case that made this obvious: it lives at
 * `/tasks/<id>/fix` whichever door you came through, so its trail always began at Tasks
 * — even for the advocate who reached it from the "Returned with defects" tab of their
 * filings queue, two areas away. Following that root did not take them back; it moved
 * them.
 *
 * So the door is recorded when it is used. A cross-area link carries `?from=<relative
 * URL>`, the screen it lands on roots its trail there, and the way back is the exact URL
 * the person left — tab, search, sort and page still on it.
 *
 * The value is a **relative path only**, checked on the way in and on the way out. It
 * arrives from the address bar, which anyone can type into, and it is rendered as an
 * `href`: an absolute URL or a protocol-relative `//host` would turn the breadcrumb root
 * into an off-site link.
