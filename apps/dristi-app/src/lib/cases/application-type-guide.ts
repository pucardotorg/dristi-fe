/**
 * What each application type asks the court for, and the search that finds it
 * from a sentence.
 *
 * The descriptions are the only place the chooser explains a type, so each one
 * states the ask in the words of the filer and stays inside what that type's
 * form actually collects (`application-type-fields.tsx`) and what the national
 * process supports (`docs/product/domain/journey.md`). No type promises a
 * field or an outcome the flow does not have.
 *
 * The substance of the law, never its citation. "Sufficient cause" and
 * "compounded" are the real statutory standards and are the words a filer
 * meets in court, so they stay; the section numbers behind them do not appear
 * anywhere in the UI. A number on a card face is something to look up, not
 * something to decide by.
 *
 * Each line also has to survive two other places: the chosen-type card on the
 * second step, where there is no grid to refer to, and the card's aria-label,
 * read aloud as "<label>: <description>". So none of them points at the screen
 * around it, and each stays short enough for a three-up card to hold without
 * clamping.
 *
 * The search is a local keyword match, not a language model: a filer types the
 * request the way they would say it, the words every request shares ("I want
 * to file…") are dropped, and what is left is scored against each type's own
 * vocabulary. Nothing leaves the browser, and a miss costs nothing — every
 * type stays on the screen, ranked rather than hidden.
