/**
 * The litigant profile's own cases — demo fixtures, no backend.
 *
 * The litigant profile used to show an empty Cases page: the advocate's
 * fixtures are not a litigant's to see, and nothing else existed. The
 * Application Lifecycle PRD gives a litigant (and a PoA holder, and a party
 * in person) their own rights on applications, so the profile needs cases
 * it is actually on. One per seat the PRD names:
 *
 * - `lt-2201`: the account holder files her own complaint with no advocate,
 *   a party in person. She drafts, signs, pays and objects herself.
 * - `lt-2202`: she is the accused, with an advocate. She pays for what is
 *   filed on her behalf and sees what is submitted.
 * - `lt-2203`: she holds her mother's power of attorney in her mother's
 *   complaint. She pays for what is filed on her mother's behalf.
 *
 * Kept out of `CASES` so the advocate's Cases list, counts and tests do not
 * change. `findCaseRecord` resolves an id against both.
