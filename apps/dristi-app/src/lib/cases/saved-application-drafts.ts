/**
 * Applications filed from the Raise application form in this browser —
 * demo persistence, no backend. Drafts first (Save as draft), and since
 * Sept 24 anything the form's chain ends on too: waiting for a signature
 * (signed later, or a clerk's hand-off to the advocate), waiting for
 * payment, or paid. Before that, nothing filed from the form ever reached
 * the register.
 *
 * "Save as draft" on the Raise application form has to leave something the
 * filer can come back to, or the button is a promise the prototype cannot
 * keep. So a saved draft is written here, per case, and the Applications
 * register reads it back as a Draft row whose "Continue draft" reopens the
 * form. The same shape the register already resumes pack drafts from: the
 * type, a title, and the ask in the filer's words (see
 * `applicationDraftFrom`). Files and dates are not kept, exactly as with the
 * pack's drafts.
 *
 * Read with `useLocalStorageValue(savedDraftsKey(caseId))` and parse with
 * `parseSavedDrafts`, so every reader updates when one is saved.
