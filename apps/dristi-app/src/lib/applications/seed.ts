/**
 * Sample applications, so both court queues have something in them on a fresh browser.
 *
 * Every one is built by running the real lifecycle steps (`lifecycle.ts`) on a real
 * fixture case, dated relative to today — so the due dates, numbers, objection deadlines
 * and set-a-date history are exactly what filing them by hand would have produced.
 * Applications filed through the advocate side add to these. "Reset sandbox data"
 * (`resetApplications`) brings the samples back.
