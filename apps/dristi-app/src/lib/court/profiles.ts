/**
 * Which state's court the app runs as — the deployment switch in the rail (`CourtSwitch`).
 *
 * DRISTI is one shared core deployed per state (`docs/product/national-vs-state.md`).
 * Kerala is what every screen was designed against, so its profile changes nothing: the
 * fixtures, documents and fees already speak Kerala. The other three re-voice the same
 * screens with what the stakeholders' documents say differs (owner, 2026-10-08): the
 * product's name and logo, the case numbers, the fees, and — for Punjab only — that the
 * filing step is signing alone, with no oath.
 *
 * The interface does not change between them. Nothing here adds a step, a field or a
 * queue; a Gujarat case already carries its eCC / eCR type rather than asking the clerk
 * to pick one.
 *
 * Sources: "Case Numbering System" sheets for Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab & Haryana, and
 * "Payment Logic" (schedule 1 Kerala, 2 Gujarat, 3 Punjab and Haryana), shared in the
 * owner's chat on 2026-10-08. Punjab and Haryana run as 24×7 ON Courts, like Kerala;
 * Gujarat's product is Saras, with a placeholder logo until it sends its own (owner,
 * 2026-10-08).
