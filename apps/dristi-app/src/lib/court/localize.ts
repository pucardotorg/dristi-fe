/**
 * Kerala's words and numbers, re-voiced for another state's court.
 *
 * Every fixture, document and seed in this app is written in Kerala's terms — that is
 * the state it was designed against, and the owner keeps it as the baseline. Rather than
 * fork a thousand-odd fixtures per state, the screens show them through this function:
 * the same case, numbered and headed the way the selected state's court would.
 *
 * It is a display transform, never a data one. Lookups, filters and the sandbox store
 * keep the Kerala value; only what a reader sees passes through here. For Kerala it is
 * the identity, so the designed screens are exactly as they were.
 *
 * What changes, and from which source (owner's documents, 2026-10-08):
 *
 * - **Court and product names.** In Gujarat "24×7 ON Courts" becomes SARAS 2.0 and
 *   "24×7 ON Court" the SARAS Court, and DRISTI is never named (owner, 2026-10-09); a bench gains its state
 *   ("JMFC Court 1, Gujarat") where Kerala's demo left the district out.
 * - **Filing number.** Kerala's `KL-000049-2025` — Gujarat's e-filing number keeps the
 *   platform's shape with its own tenant; Punjab & Haryana's is `NACT/49/2025`.
 * - **Registration (CMP).** Gujarat allots `eCC`, `eCR EN` or `eCR MA` by the case's
 *   classification at scrutiny; Punjab & Haryana allot the `NACT` case number.
 * - **Cognizance (ST).** Gujarat's case number is always `eCC`; Punjab & Haryana's case
 *   number was allotted at registration and carries on.
 * - **CNR.** The state, district and establishment prefix changes; the sequence and
 *   year do not.
 * - **Signing.** Punjab's filing step is "Sign", where the others' is "Sign and oath".
