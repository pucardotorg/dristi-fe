/**
 * Reading and writing a filing draft at the place a scrutiny defect points.
 *
 * A `DefectTarget` is `{ step, instance, field }` or `{ step, slotKey }`; this is the one
 * place that turns that into a value on the draft. Keeping it pure and in `lib/` means
 * the resolution derivation can be tested without rendering the form.
 *
 * Only the steps a defect can currently be raised against are mapped — and `FieldTarget`
 * is typed from that map, so a defect cannot be *authored* against a step the form cannot
 * show. It used to admit `accused`, `witnesses`, `advocate` and `adr-prayer`: those
 * sections have no `name=` on their fields and no `CorrectionInstance` around their
 * repeating records, so a defect pointing at one rendered no frame at all — invisible on
 * the screen, and permanently short of the submit gate. A type that admits a target the
 * form cannot render is not a contract, it is a trap.
 *
 * Widening it is deliberate work, not a keystroke: give the section's `FormField`s their
 * `name=`, wrap a repeating section's records in `CorrectionInstance` and wire
 * `useCorrectionInstanceRequest` (see `cheque-section.tsx` for the pattern), add the row
 * to `rowFor`, then list the fields here. `targets.test.ts` holds the line.

 *
 * A field listed here still has to be *on screen* to be corrected — several jurisdiction
 * fields appear only on one branch of the section's own questions. The frame follows the
