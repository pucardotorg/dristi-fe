/**
 * Prototype stand-in for the verification service's rejected registrations.
 * Delete when the real endpoint lands — only the sign-in block and the
 * resubmission flow read it.
 *
 * The mechanism (PM, Sept 3): a rejected registrant is told by SMS to sign
 * in again; the sign-in screen recognises the number and routes them into a
 * correction round — the registration steps minus the role question, their
 * answers pre-filled and the officer's ONE general message shown on every
 * step. The officer's field marks only tint the stepper; fields carry no
 * flags (owner, Sept 18). Resubmitting sends the same application back for
 * approval.
