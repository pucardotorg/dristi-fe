/**
 * Filtering, sorting, grouping and counting — pure, over the loaded world.
 *
 * The screen's state (view tab, kind pill, the labelled filters, search) lives in the
 * URL as `Filters`.
 *
 * ## One count contract
 *
 * Every count on the screen follows the rows the list is showing, except the four tab
 * counts, which have to be cross-view to be any use. So a pill's number is what
 * pressing it yields — `kindCounts` applies the whole filter set *except* the kind —
 * and a band's number is the rows under it. The pills used to be six cards counting the
 * tab while the table counted the filters, which is how a card could read 5 above an
 * empty list (2026-09-15).
 *
 * Everything here is presentation-agnostic: the home screen shows the same tasks in a
 * smaller frame, so grouping and counting live in this module rather than in the screen.
