 * `/employee/*` — the court-staff area: magistrate, bench clerk, scrutiny officer,
 * typist.
 *
 * Kept apart from `/citizen/*` (advocates, litigants, clerks, parties in person) so the
 * two can be built in parallel without colliding. Nothing here reaches into the citizen
 * screens and nothing there reaches in here — including the app shell, which is the
 * advocate's product and not the bench's.
 *
 * This layout carries the segment's metadata and nothing else. The chrome belongs one
 * level down, to the `(court)` group, so that `/employee/login` can be an `/employee`
 * route without wearing the bench's rail — see `(court)/layout.tsx`.
