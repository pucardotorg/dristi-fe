/**
 * `/` — the front door.
 *
 * The one job is to route the two people who arrive here — the citizen bringing or
 * answering a case, and the court staff who run the bench — to their own sign-in, and to
 * do it with the standing of a government court rather than the gloss of a product.
 *
 * So the whole page is the deep-teal institutional plate the two sign-ins already stand
 * on: the front door is made of the same material as the rooms behind it, and the two
 * entrances are the lit way in. It is mode-invariant by design (the `brand-canvas` tokens
 * are fixed in both themes — a court's front door does not go light or dark with a
 * preference). This replaces a generic two-card page; the earlier "what the platform
 * does" band is gone, because each entrance already says what its side is for and a
 * front door is not a brochure.
 *
 * English only, and the citizen sign-in past this door carries the Malayalam — a toggle
 * here would translate four sentences and then hand over to a screen with its own.
